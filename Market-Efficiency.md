## Introducing Consumer & Producer Surplus

#### Consumer Surplus
>The difference between what a consumer is prepared to pay and what they actually pay in the market.
- Area below the demand curve and above the price point
- Marginal Benefit: Extra benefit from consuming one extra unit of the good or services.

#### Producer Surplus
>Difference between what a producer is willing to receive and what they actually receive in a market.
-   Area above the supply curve and below the price point
-   Marginal Cost: The extra opportunity cost of producing one more unit of a good or service.

Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus = Total Surplus


#### Total Surplus
>The measure of the net benefits to society from the production and consumption of the good.
-   Allocated Efficiency is achieved

#### Deadweight Loss
>The loss in Total Surplus that is avoidable.


We must maximise the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in a market - Using all resources optimally
- A desirable objective of an economic system is to maximize the well-being of society, and therefore to achieve this, we need to maximise total surplus.


## Effect of Taxes/Subsidies/Ceilings/Floors on Efficiency

#### Efficiency
>Producing the goods that producers want at the lowest possible price

Producing what society demands is called Allocative Efficiency


#### What is a Price Ceiling?
- It's the highest price that a producer can charge on a good or service
- It is usually below the equilibrium price
- Intended to keep prices affordable for majority of the population
---
- Needed for rationing process to regulate demand
- Could lead to black markets

#### What is a Price Floor?
- It's the minimum price that a producer can charge on a good or service
- It is usually above the equilibrium price
- Designed to ensure that there is a minimum income received by producers
---
- Informal illegal markets could result where workers are paid less than the minimum wage

#### The Steps for Success - Price Ceilings and Floors Diagrams

1. Original Price and Quantity
2. Implement Price Ceiling / Floor (Above or Below Equilibrium)
3. New Price and Quantity
4. Qd / Qs -> Shortage or Surplus
5. CS / PS / TS / DWL
6. Loss of Efficiency


#### What are Taxes?
They can be:
- Direct Taxes (Income Tax)
- Indirect Taxes
	- Consumers do not pay the tax directly, but are affected through changes in the price of the good or services.
		- Specific Tax: The tax is an fixed amount or is a set sum of money per unit
		- Ad Valorem Tax: Where the tax is a percentage of the value of the transaction, e.g GST

**Tax Objectives:**
-   Aid in the redistribution of income
-   To correct externalities
-   To earn revenue

**Impact of Taxes:**
-   Reduces quantity while increase price
-   Tax incidence depends on the elasticity of the good/service
-   Creates a DWL

#### The Steps for Success - Taxes Diagrams

1.  Original Price / Quantity
2.  Implement Government Policy (Tax)
3.  New Price / Quantity
4.  Tax Revenue
5.  CS / PS / TS / DWL
6.  Conclusion on Efficiency


#### What are Subsidies?
-   Subsidies are payments by the government to a firm to reduce production costs and increase output

**Subsidy Objectives**:
-   To encourage production of goods with positive externalities
-   Allows the producer to export more
-   Aid expansion of the firm

**Impact of subsidies:**
-   DWL as part of government expenditure on the subsidy is not translated into either consumer or producer surplus
