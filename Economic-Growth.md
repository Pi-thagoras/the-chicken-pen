Chapter 7...

**Target for GDP: 3 - 4%**

Definition: An increase in capacity of an economy to produce goods and services over time.
- The increasing capacity of the economy to satisfy the material wants of the society.

1. Potential Growth: The rate of **increase in the capacity** of the economy to satisfy the needs and wants of people in an economy
2. Actual Growth: The rate of change in **real gross domestic product** over a given period of time.

This relates to Australia's macroeconomic objective of sustainable economic growth.


### PPF Model (Production Possibility Frontier)

X Axis: Consumer Goods
Y Axis: Capital Goods

#### Actual Growth

If economy is operating inside the PPF, and produces more as a result of using previously unemployed resources, or using resources more efficiently, this is referred to as actual growth.
- This is illustrated by a movement of a point from within the PPF towards the PPF curve.

#### Potential Growth

The productivity potential of an economy may be increased by an increase in the quality and/or quality of resources and, when this occurs, this is known as potential growth.
- Potential Growth is illustrated by a movement of the PPF curve itself outwards

### Measuring Economic Growth

The economic growth rate is the rate of change in GDP
GDP: The total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country during a certain time period

Calculation:

$$\frac{GDP_{yr2}\space - GDP_{yr1}}{GDP_{yr1}}*100$$


Nominal GDP: The value of output expressed in the prices of the day
Real GDP: Value of GDP after taking into account  the value of inflation
- Real GDP growth rate (%)
	- Nominal GDP growth rate - Inflation Rate
Real GDP per Capita: Average real GDP per person in the population


#### Limitations of GDP:

- Residents can still be unhappy even when GDP increases
	- Doesn't describe non-material welfare
- Doesn't describe income distribution
- Non-market production is not accounted for
	- Black Market
	- Private
	- Volunteering
	- Cash Work
- It ignores externalities
- GDP can be not sustainable
- True Value of public goods and merit goods is largely unknown
- Understates changes in utility (Ability of goods and services to satisfy wants)
	- Doesn't capture significant technological progress that increases utility without increasing price by much.
- Doesn't account for rising productivity
