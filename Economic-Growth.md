Chapter 7...

**Target for GDP: 3 - 4%**

Definition: An increase in capacity of an economy to produce goods and services over time.
- The increasing capacity of the economy to satisfy the material wants of the society.

1. Potential Growth: The rate of **increase in the capacity** of the economy to satisfy the needs and wants of people in an economy
2. Actual Growth: The rate of change in **real gross domestic product** over a given period of time.

This relates to Australia's macroeconomic objective of sustainable economic growth.


### PPF Model (Production Possibility Frontier)

Axis:
- X Axis: Consumer Goods
- Y Axis: Capital Goods

#### Actual Growth

If economy is operating inside the PPF, and produces more as a result of using previously unemployed resources, or using resources more efficiently, this is referred to as actual growth.
- This is illustrated by a movement of a point from within the PPF towards the PPF curve.

#### Potential Growth

The productivity potential of an economy may be increased by an increase in the quality and/or quality of resources and, when this occurs, this is known as potential growth.
- Potential Growth is illustrated by a movement of the PPF curve itself outwards

### Measuring Economic Growth

The economic growth rate is the rate of change in GDP

GDP: The total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country during a certain time period

Calculation:

$$\frac{GDP_{yr2}\space - GDP_{yr1}}{GDP_{yr1}}*100$$

Types of GDP:
- Nominal GDP: The value of output expressed in the prices of the day
- Real GDP: Value of GDP after taking into account  the value of inflation
	- Real GDP growth rate (%)
		- Nominal GDP growth rate - Inflation Rate
Real GDP per Capita: Average real GDP per person in the population


#### Limitations of GDP:

- Residents can still be unhappy even when GDP increases
	- Doesn't describe non-material welfare
- Doesn't describe income distribution
- Non-market production is not accounted for
	- Black Market
	- Private
	- Volunteering
	- Cash Work
- It ignores externalities
- GDP can be not sustainable
- True Value of public goods and merit goods is largely unknown
- Understates changes in utility (Ability of goods and services to satisfy wants)
	- Doesn't capture significant technological progress that increases utility without increasing price by much.
- Doesn't account for rising productivity


## Determinants of Economic Growth

Growth can come from both:
- **Potential Growth**
	- Those that increase the capacity of the economy to produce more goods and services with available resources (Supply Side)
- **Actual Growth**
	- How much expenditure is taking place to consume those goods and services (Demand Side)

#### Population Growth:

- Increase the total size of the economy : Greater demand for G + S and productive factors
- Increase in size of labour force: Migration and natural increase
- Migration more than natural: Migration promotes transfer of wealth, knowledge, skills and positive fiscal impact.

#### Labour Force Participation

- Proportion of people over 15 years old who are in paid work or actively looking for work
- Higher involvement at work: Increase capacity of production (overcome effect of aging workforce)
- Sustain government tax revenue

#### Rising Labour Productivity

- Amount of output produced per hour worked
**Capital Deepening**
- Increasing the stock of capital relative to the stock of other productive resources
- Production becomes more capital intensive: Increasing about productivity
- Technology changes and improvements of function which hel to increase the amount of output.
Capital Widening: Same thing but with more people as well 

**Multi-factor Productivity:** All other factors that improve worker's ability to produce goods and services (not capita)
- Changes in human capital, knowledge and skills that workers develop through education and experience, improved by education etc.

## Determinants of Actual Growth

Affecting Spending:
- Consumption
- Investment
- Government Expenditure
- Net Exports
