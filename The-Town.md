title: "The Town"
---

The Town is located in a no better place than... the desert. Woo! Literally one of the harshest biomes to be living in (Deserts include polar deserts yes, but this desert is like Arrakis - expansive and hot, minus the sandworms). You have to be careful of countless things. Heatstrokes, rattlesnakes, and entire sandstorms. I have no clue how the inhabitants of this Town survived this long, but their houses are still intact.

The Town consists of:
- [M.Spicata](https://spicata.github.io/), who owns a multi-storey house with a garden filled with fresh plants. He has a variety of things lying here and there, including mini hand-drawn stickman entertainment to keep you entertained (what else would entertainment do) in case of flash sandstorms, but also journals outside - in his garden - where it can rain.
- [DefinitelyEddie](https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/), he lives in a quartz house and likes to keep his lights off even when he has guests (and when he finally switches the lights on, you go blind and can't see a thing). He's ~~an evil~~ a very resourceful chem-lover who synthesizes me- *cough cough* memorandums for other people to see in his basement.
- [Mace](https://macesnotes.netlify.app/), aka MaceFaceCurryCase has one of two largest computer science libraries. His house is different from the others, maybe because he can utilise his compsci skills to construct his house with sand, cacti and dead bushes. Don't ask how everyone else built their's.
- [NotMario](https://notmario.github.io/thenotes/), who is an amazing coder. When I said 'one of the two largest computer science libraries', the other largest computer science library is owned by him. His house has minimal CSS to hold up the roof but it still holds many things to look at.
- [Anonymoof](https://anonymoof1528.github.io/into-the-shadow-garten/), not bidoof because beavers don't live in the desert. He complains about japanese  but in reality we all know he is the best at jap. Those living in (and visiting) the Town can hear him ranting (about everything) from the other side of the Town.
- [Grim4Reaper](https://grim4reaper.github.io/Year11Notes/), or MQ-9 Reaper or just to make it easy, Reaper, lives in a house that is also built from quartz which he is slowly but surely moving into from his previous house, which has detailed economics writings.
- [NotTacoz](https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/), he lives in (i wish - treehouses are cool)/next to his Jacaranda Tree (not Jacurutu) - for your convinence it's a tree that blossoms attractive violet/pinkish flowers. He brought it from elsewhere to the desert because once again, they don't naturally occur in the desert. 
- [Jonathan](https://nottaro.github.io/littleroot/), who lives in a quartz house that looks awfully similar to DefinitelyEddie's house. Apparently he is 6"10', which justifies the huge entrance he has. He also occasionally tours those who visit the Town.
- [Shan-Mei](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/), she loves music and journals her everyday experiences living *among us* [^1] in the Town. She's the youngest resident, but that doesn't stop her from producing lots of informative content and smooth CSS decor.
- [Joel](https://rubver16.github.io/joles-notes/), the 6th quartz house in the Town. He plans to add mainly maths and a bit of science in his house. (He is still updating his website)
- [Athu](https://super-cookies.github.io/duk/), the 7th quartz house. He has alot of maths... except he doesn't. (You'll see) (He is still updating his website)
- [Choyu](https://grimreaper2654.github.io/Notes/), he has a totally non-AI generated Shan-Mei lore that didn't pop up with 61.3% AI generated in an AI detection tool. He is an amazing coder who can code about anything from a spaceship battle pew pew game, to a dating simulator which simulates what you wish you could have, to a random element fill in the blanks chemistry reviser. Also a turkey lover.
- And [me](https://pi-thagoras.github.io/the-chicken-pen/) (Who doesn't use Quartz because *nearly* everyone is using Quartz - I recommend using Jekyll for those learning younglings out there - DON'T JOIN THE QUARTZ SIDE [^2]) :)



[^1]: I had to add it somewhere don't blame me


[^2]: Jekyll: Yes, Jekyll user's strength flows with the force. But beware of the quartz side. Anger, fear, aggression; the quartz side of the force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the quartz path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Edward and his apprentices. -- A Learning Youngling: Is Edward... Is the quartz side stronger? -- Jekyll: No, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. -- A Learning Youngling: But how am I to know the good side from the bad? -- Jekyll: You will know... when you are calm, at peace, passive. Jekyll users use the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.



Note: That took alot of time, but it was worth it. Have fun reading!
