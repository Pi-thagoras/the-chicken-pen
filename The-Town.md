title: "The Town"
---

The Town is located in a no better place than... the desert. Woo! Literally one of the harshest biomes to be living in (Deserts include polar deserts yes, but this desert is like Arrakis - expansive and hot, minus the sandworms). You have to be careful of countless things. Heatstrokes, rattlesnakes, and entire sandstorms. I have no clue how the inhabitants of this Town survived this long, but their houses are still intact.

The Town consists of 21 people so far (plus minus a number of people ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ):
- [M.Spicata](https://spicata.github.io/), who owns a multi-storey house with a garden filled with fresh plants. He has a variety of things lying here and there, including mini hand-drawn stickman entertainment to keep you entertained (what else would entertainment do) in case of flash sandstorms, but also journals outside - in his garden - where it can rain.
- [DefinitelyEddie](https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/), he lives in a quartz house and likes to keep his lights off even when he has guests (and when he finally switches the lights on, you go blind and can't see a thing). He's ~~an evil~~ a very resourceful chem-lover who synthesizes me- *cough cough* memorandums for other people to see in his basement.
- [Mace](https://macesnotes.netlify.app/), aka MaceFaceCurryCase has one of two largest computer science libraries. His house is different from the others, maybe because he can utilise his compsci skills to construct his house with sand, cacti and dead bushes. Don't ask how everyone else built their's.
- [NotMario](https://notmario.github.io/thenotes/), who is an amazing coder. When I said 'one of the two largest computer science libraries', the other largest computer science library is owned by him. His house has minimal CSS to hold up the roof but it still holds many things to look at.
- [Anonymoof](https://shadowgarten.toomwn.xyz/), not bidoof because beavers don't live in the desert. He complains about japanese but in reality we all know he is the best at jap. Those living in (and visiting) the Town can hear him ranting (about everything) from the other side of the Town.
- [Grim4Reaper](https://grim4reaper.github.io/Year11Notes/), or MQ-9 Reaper or just to make it easy, Reaper, lives in a house that is also built from quartz which he is slowly but surely moving into from his previous house, which has detailed economics writings.
- [NotTacoz](https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/), he lives in (I wish - treehouses are cool)/next to his Jacaranda Tree (not Jacurutu) - for your convenience it's a tree that blossoms attractive violet/pinkish flowers. He brought it from elsewhere to the desert because once again, they don't naturally occur in the desert. 
- [Jonathan](https://nottaro.github.io/littleroot/), who lives in a quartz house that looks awfully similar to DefinitelyEddie's house. Apparently he is 6"10', which justifies the huge entrance he has. He also occasionally tours those who visit the Town.
- [Shan-Mei](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/), she loves music and journals her everyday experiences living *among us* [^1] in the Town. She's the youngest resident, but that doesn't stop her from producing lots of informative content and encasing it in smooth CSS décor.
- [Joel](https://rubver16.github.io/joles-notes/), the 6th quartz house in the Town. He has a long page on specialist maths in his amazingly coloured house.
- [Athu](https://super-cookies.github.io/duk/), the 7th quartz house. He has a lot of maths... except he doesn't. (You'll see) (He is still updating his website)
- [Choyu](https://grimreaper2654.github.io/Notes/), he has a totally non-AI generated Shan-Mei lore that didn't pop up with 61.3% AI generated in an AI detection tool. He is an amazing coder who can code about anything from a spaceship battle pew pew game, to a dating simulator which simulates what you wish you could have, to a random element fill in the blanks chemistry reviser. Also a turkey lover.
- [Loren](https://ionized-satellite-e99.notion.site/Loren-s-Garden-cd03827de0a743468d9fb5a70413fc95), our first notion user... which leads to more notion overpopulation. She owns a garden cafe where you can go to relax and buy flowers as souvenirs.
- [The Wanderer](https://wanderer.toomwn.xyz/), who used to wander the farlands, until he wandered no further - settling in this wonderful Town. He has gathered various scrolls from different parts of the world (he even delved into love language hahaha).
- [The Merchant](https://harzavad.github.io/the-merchant/), he has set up a stall where he occasionally resides, but he is seen most of the time at his warehouse. It may look small from the outside, but once you enter, it's filled with ancient items, littering the floor as well as stacked into huge mountains.
- [Beatrice](https://beatricesychong.wixsite.com/notes), who has had a house for quite a while but moved to the Town later on. Her house has many safety features before you can enter - and therefore is probably the more guarded houses. CONSTANT VIGILANCE
- [Ajay](https://baju-s.toomwn.xyz/), his house is clean cut, and has as much information as byju's, but is far better with superior explanations.
- [Claudia](https://cshc.notion.site/cshc/claudia-s-life-planner-c23280690bef46b79adee2d0773c5591), she is another notion user, her dwelling full of pink posters, panels and even pets (or what it's wearing). She is M.Spicata's sister who ~~may have a more matured brain than her brother~~ reads a lot.
- [Kat](https://coreonett.notion.site/coreonett/Year-11-Notes-6978dbec99e943649a3a0773b2ee0587), who loves to design bits and bobs around her house, as well as hang brains around to analyze later.
- [Geobear](https://geobears-owner.github.io/smarting-up/bank/home/), he lives in place you wouldn't want to be (or maybe you do). You might want to *bear* with him as he slowly moves into his new house.
- And [me](https://pi-thagoras.github.io/the-chicken-pen/) (Who doesn't use Quartz because *nearly* everyone is using Quartz - I recommend using Jekyll for those learning younglings out there - DON'T JOIN THE QUARTZ SIDE [^2]) :)


[^1]: I had to add it somewhere don't blame me


[^2]: Jekyll: Yes, Jekyll user's strength flows with the force. But beware of the quartz side. Anger, fear, aggression; the quartz side of the force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the quartz path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Edward and his apprentices. -- A Learning Youngling: Is Edward... Is the quartz side stronger? -- Jekyll: No, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. -- A Learning Youngling: But how am I to know the good side from the bad? -- Jekyll: You will know... when you are calm, at peace, passive. Jekyll users use the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
