## What is/are Nanotechnology, Nanoparticles, & Nanometers?

**Nanotechnology** is the study of materials within the nanoscale.

**Nanoparticles** are defined as particles that are between 1 to 100nm (the nanoscale) in size.

A nanometer is 1 x 10$^{-9}$ meters - One billionth of a meter or 0.000000001 meters

**Nanomaterials**
- Are made of nanoparticles!
- Substances that are composed of units that exist in the nanoscale.


Properties differ between non-nanoparticle and nanoparticle.
- E.g. Colour
	- Normal Gold -> Yellow
	- Nanoparticle Gold -> Red
	- Normal Zinc Oxide -> White
	- Nanoparticle Zinc Oxide -> Transparent
		- This is used in sunscreen
- E.g. Strength
	- Carbon nanotubes and fibres
	- Complex shapes
		- Motors
		- Nanobots
		- Medicine
