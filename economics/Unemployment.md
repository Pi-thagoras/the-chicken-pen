title: "Unemployment"
---

Definition: Refers to the people who are willing and able to work but cannot find a job.
- Can either be voluntary or involuntary

**Unemployment Rate** is the proportion of labour force who are willing and able to work, but are unable to find job.
- (Number of People who are unemployed / Labour Force) x 100

**Labour Force Participation Rate:**
- (Labour Force / Working Age Population) x 100

#### Limitations to Unemployment Rate & Labour Force Participation Rate

Does not account for hidden unemployment
Does not account for underemployment
Excludes people with disabilities

Key Words:
- **Working Age Population:** Part of the proportion that is of working age (>15)
- **Labour Force:** The portion of the working age population who are either working, or are actively are seeking work
- **Participation Rate:** The proportion of the working age proportion of the working age population who are either working, or actively seeking rate - Labour Force / Working Age Population
- **Underemployment:** People who wish to work longer hours but cannot/is not given it by their employer
- **Disguised Unemployment:** Underemployment
- **Hidden Unemployed:**
	- Discouraged Worker: Workers who choose not to participate in the labour force because previous efforts to find a job have been frustrated
- **Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment:**
	- NAIRU: Unemployment that can not be reduced by expanding aggregate demand (Full Employment)

Instead of hiring overseas people (working holidays), they employed Australian citizens. This is why unemployment decreased from 2020.

### Types of Unemployment

**Cyclical Unemployment**
- Follows the cyclical movements of the business cycle
- Derive from the demand for final goods and services and follows fluctuation of the business cycle
- Can be 0 at peak of business cycle

**Structural Unemployment**
- When there is a mismatch of available and required skills in a sector of the economy
	- E.g. The replacement of labour by capital
- Causes:
	- Changes in technology
	- Changes in the demand for productive factors
	- Changes in the pattern of consumer demand
- Can be long term, especially for older workers
	- Older Workers -> Harder to learn new skills (Not as adaptive)
- Always exists in the economy

**Frictional Unemployment**
- Unemployment that occurs due to the job search that occurs when in transition between different jobs
- Is most likely to be short term
	- Typically you leave a job when you know there is another job to switch into
- Always will exist in the economy

### Impacts of Unemployment

**Lower Levels of Aggregate Expenditure, Investment, and Business Confidence**
- UE indicates that resources are under-utilised
- There is a gap between actual GDP and potential GDP

**Higher Welfare Payments**
- Opportunity Cost: Potential expenditure on infrastructure, health, or education (MERIT GOODS)

**Increased Social Problems**
- E.g. Depression, Violence, Crime
- Lower amounts of income...

### Impact on Distribution of Income

- Affects different groups of people differently
	- Dependent on factors including age, health status, education and geographical location
- Increases Income Inequality

### Full Employment

- When an economy is at its maximum production capacity
- Considered to exist when there is zero cyclical unemployment
- When there are enough jobs for the people who are available and want to work.
- When the economy is at maximum production capacity


Natural Rate of Unemployment: Structural Unemployment + Frictional Unemployment -> Below 5%


### NAIRU

- Key challenge for policymakers is to achieve a low rate of unemployment without fuelling excessive increases in wage growths and inflation.
- Economics call the lowest rate of unemployment that achieves this the 'non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment'
- The NAIRU is the lowest unemployment rate that can be sustained without causing wage growth and inflation to rise
- There will e spare capacity in an economy when aggregate demand for goods and services is less that the economy's capacity to produce them.
- A key indicator of spare capacity in an economy is the difference between the NAIRU and the unemployment rate - sometimes know as the unemployment rate gap

### Implication of full employment

- Economy is nearing or at full capacity
- Can lead to oversupply of labour
- Creates inflationary pressure
	- Producers are unable to easily increase supply to meet demand

### The Trade Off between Unemployment and Inflation

- Low unemployment is usually correlated with high inflation
	- Low Unemployment leads to inflationary pressure due to high levels of demand
- Higher unemployment is usually correlated with low inflation
	- Unemployment means that resources are under-utilised and therefore demand is lower
- Achieving the economic targets of low inflation and low unemployment would involve a trade-off as the two targets contradict each other.

This can be represented with the Phillips Curve.
