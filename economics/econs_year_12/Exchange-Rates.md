An exchange rate is simply the **price** of one **country's currency** in terms of **another country's currency**.

### Foreign Exchange Market

Foreign Exchange (Forex) - Used to describe foreign currency

The **foreign exchange market** is the **market** in which the **currencies** of different countries are **bought** and **sold**:
- Foreign exchange is the currency of another country that is needed to carry out international transactions
- The foreign exchange market between Australia and US consists of 2 groups of people: those demanding US dollars - an Australian importer of US goods; and those demanding Australian dollars – an American buyer of Australian goods.
- *Demand for US dollars is matched by a supply of Australian dollars, while a demand for Australian dollars is matched by a supply of US dollars*
	- I am an American buyer for Australian goods. I have American dollars with me. I go to the forex market, and sell my USD in exchange for AUD. Increases demand for AUD and increases supply of USD.
- An Australian farmer selling wheat wants to be paid in Australian dollars, while an American computer manufacturer prefers to receive US dollars.
	- Every seller wants to receive their own currency

Exchange Rates are *almost always* linked to **trade balance**.

We will focus on floating exchange rates:
- There are two basic methods for determining the price of a country's currency – **by allowing the market forces of supply and demand to freely set the value** OR **by artificially setting the price at a fixed rate.**
