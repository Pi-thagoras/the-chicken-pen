An exchange rate is simply the **price** of one **country's currency** in terms of **another country's currency**.

### Foreign Exchange Market

Foreign Exchange (Forex) - Used to describe foreign currency

The **foreign exchange market** is the **market** in which the **currencies** of different countries are **bought** and **sold**:
- Foreign exchange is the currency of another country that is needed to carry out international transactions
- The foreign exchange market between Australia and US consists of 2 groups of people: those demanding US dollars - an Australian importer of US goods; and those demanding Australian dollars – an American buyer of Australian goods.
- *Demand for US dollars is matched by a supply of Australian dollars, while a demand for Australian dollars is matched by a supply of US dollars*
	- I am an American buyer for Australian goods. I have American dollars with me. I go to the forex market, and sell my USD in exchange for AUD. Increases demand for AUD and increases supply of USD.
- An Australian farmer selling wheat wants to be paid in Australian dollars, while an American computer manufacturer prefers to receive US dollars.
	- Every seller wants to receive their own currency

Exchange Rates are *almost always* linked to **trade balance**.

We will focus on floating exchange rates:
- There are two basic methods for determining the price of a country's currency – **by allowing the market forces of supply and demand to freely set the value** OR **by artificially setting the price at a fixed rate.**
- Australia has a floating exchange rate resume
- To influence exchange rates, the central bank may buy/sell currency to change the exchange rates.
	- When the currency is allowed to float free from the interference of the central bank (RBA), then it is referred to as a clean float
	- Whenever the central bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market to influence the movement of the currency, or to set its value in a particular ‘range’ then it is rereferred to as a ‘dirty float’.
- The reserve bank can indirectly lower the exchange rate by simply reducing interest rates - this would reduce the demand for the currency
- On the other hand, increasing the interest rates (by increasing the cash rate), more investments will be done (by foreign investors) as it is more appealing (more returns)

Australia's Exchange Rate Resume
- The reserve bank of Australia claims that it only enters the foreign exchange market occasionally with a view to ‘testing and smoothing’ the underlying trend in the exchange rate
- This is sometimes referred to as a lightly managed float. (Answer in assessment as freely floating)



All transactions that result in an **inflow of money** into the Australian economy, in both the current account and the capital and financial account, **represent a demand** for a country’s currency

Transactions that result in an **outflow of money**, on the other hand, **represent the supply** of a country's currency

Most international transactions are contracted in one of the key world currencies, for example, USD, Japanese Yen, Pounds Sterling (GBP) or the Euro (EURO).
- In terms of Australia's Trade, around **two thirds of exports** and **one half of imports** are contracted in **USD** - The remainder of Australia trade is contracted in AUD
- Don't get confused, for test purposes use AUD for Australia's goods.


The **Demand for a currency** will be determined by:
1. Exports of goods and services
2. Receipts of income from overseas; and
3. Capital inflow (foreign investment into Australia)

The **Supply of a currency** will be determined by:
1. Imports of goods and services;
2. Payments of income to overseas; and
3. Capital outflow

Changes in BOP transactions involving goods, services, income or financial capital, will affect either the demand and/or supply of the currency and thus affect it’s value.
