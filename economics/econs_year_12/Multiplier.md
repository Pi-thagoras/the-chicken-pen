## The Multiplier: Changes in Expenditure

Shifts in AE curve changes income.

The following events would result in a higher level of AE – the AE line in the model would shift upwards at all levels of disposable income:
- A **rise in retail spending** due to an increase in consumers confidence : Component?
- An **increase in wheat exports** to the middle east
- An **increase in business investment** associated with new clean energy projects

Multiplier Effect:
- ‘one mans’ spending is another man’s income’
	- Make sure to describe this in your own words (elaborate when mentioning it)
	- Consumption have knock on effects, resulting in increase income that is greater than the initial amount spent.

E.G. Initially, we assume our economy has just 3 sectors - households, firms and the financial sector - Aggregate expenditure therefore consists of consumption + investment
- Assume a mining company decides to spend $10 billion to develop a mine site and rail link in Western Australia.
- The initial (new) investment creates income for contractor firms and their employees, including engineers, architects and construction workers.
- These people (households) will then spend part of that income on goods and services including food, clothing rent and entertainment
- This spending will flow on to other people in the economy through the circular flow of income. 
- The final impact of the new spending is likely to be much greater than the initial value of the project

The multiplier refers to the proportion by which income will rise following an initial change in spending
- If an increase in investment of $10 billion caused the level of income to rise by $25 billion, the value of the multiplier would be 2.5 that is - the final impact on income is 2.5 times the new investment.
- The following example shows the multiplier at work and how the marginal propensity to consume determines its final impact

Definition: **The MULTIPLIER is the amount by which real income or GDP changes after an initial change in expenditure.**

Need MPC and MPS to calculate your multiplier

Multiplier Formula: 

$$k = ΔY/ΔI$$
and also the value of the multiplier is determined by the marginal propensity to consume and can be derived from the formula:

$$k = \frac{1}{1-MPC} = \frac{1}{MPS}$$
What if MPC increases: This would increase the ‘re-spending’ effect from a given change in investment and so the value of the multiplier must rise.
- Small changes in the MPC can have a dramatic effect on the size of the multiplier, as shown in the sidebar
- As the MPC increases (MPS decreases), the multiplier increases.
