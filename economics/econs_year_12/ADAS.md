title: Aggregate Demand & Aggregate Supply
layout: default

X-Axis: Real GDP
Y-Axis: **Price Levels**

Infer from the national income (x-axis) -> production and hence cyclical employment
- Other major economic indicators are shown on the ADAS diagram.

**Aggregate Demand** is the total amount of demand for final goods and services in an economy at any point in time.
- The AD curve describes a negative relationship between the level of aggregate deamand and the overall price level.
- Real GDP - the value of output produced

3 reasons for the negative relationship between AD and price level
- The income or wealth effect
	- Firstly, a rise in the price level reduces the purchasing power of household income or wealth.
	- As the price level increases the **purchasing power of household income** falls so consumption falls.
- The interest rate effect
	- Secondly, a rise in the general price level means that households and firms will demand more funds to finance their transactions.
	- They could do this by withdrawing money from banks by borrowing or by selling financial assets such as bonds.
	- The rising demand for money drives interest rates upwards, increasing the cost of borrowing and creating a disincentive to spend.
	- A rise in price levels increases interest rates, which has a negative impact on the **investment and consumption components of the AD**
- The open economy (international trade) effect
	- Thirdly, if the domestic price level rises relative to other countries, domestically produced goods and services become less competitive with those produces overseas, leading to a reduction in export revenue.
	- At the same time, a rise in the domestic price level means that consumers and business firms with purchase more goods ansd services from foreign producers and less from domestic producers.
	- In other words and increase in the price level will decrease net exports.

If there is a change other than C and I, movements along the AD curve.

### Factors that shift the AD Curve

Explain how factors affect a specific component of AD and how it affects consumption and investment.

The whole AD curve will shift to the left or the right if factors other than price level were to change.

This refers to the factors that influence consumption (C), investment (I), Government Spending (G), or net exports (X-M)
- For example the government reduces income tax, disposable income will rise and household spending will tend to increase.
- The AD curve would shift to the right - described as an **increase** in AD.

An increase in AD increases **Real GDP, General Price Levels, and Employment**

Events that affect consumption: (Link macroeconomic indicators)
- Rise in consumer confidence
- Falling Interest Rates (Borrowing and Saving)
- Increase in household wealth driven by rising share prices or property values (wealth effect)

"Impact on the economy" -> mention the three macroeconomic indicators.

### LRAS and SRAS Curves

Long Run Aggregate Supply
- Vertical due to it being the maximum capacity for the economy to produce. (Maximum productive capacity... same as PPF!)
- Anything that affect the quantity and quality of the factors of production

Short Run Aggregate Supply
- Like your normal supply curve
- Upward slope
