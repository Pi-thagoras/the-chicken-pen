Captures flow of funds and goods.

Definition: The balance of payments is a systematic record of all economic transactions between the residents of a given economy, for example Australia, and the rest of the world.

**Capital**: Goods that eventually are used in other goods

**Transfers**: Movement of funds/equipment - a one way thing

### Overview of BOP

- The Current Account
	- **Trade Balance (X-M)**
	- **Primary Income Balance**
	- Secondary Income Balance
- Capital Financial Account
	- **Financial Account**
		- Direct Investment
		- Portfolio Investment
		- Financial Derivative
		- Reserve Assets
		- Other Investment

### The Current Account

**Trade Balance** (Balance of Trade BoT)
- The **value** of goods and services that Australian residents export **less those** than they import.

**Primary Income Balance**
- The income that Australian residents earn from, **minus** what they pay to, the rest of the world from working (e.g. wages) and from financial investments (e.g. dividends)

Secondary Income Balance
- The income that Australian residents earn from, **minus** what they pay to, the rest of the world from the government (e.g. tax payments and refunds)
- Current *Transfers*: Transactions between Australian residents and the rest of the world where one party provides something to be consumed by another party without receiving anything in return (e.g. emergency food aid)
	- These tend to be **one off payments**

### Capital Financial Account (KFA)

#### Financial Account

- **Direct Investment**
	- Occurs when more than 10% of an enterprise is purchased by a foreign investor. Most of this type involves the purchase of land and the setting up of subsidiaries. For example:
		- Someone opens a foreign shop in your country
		- If a foreign entity has a more than 10% of the company
		- Purchase of Machinery, Buildings and factories
- **Portfolio Investment** (Portfolio: Financial Assets)
	- Occurs when less than 10% of a firm is acquired by a foreign investor. Most of this involves shares, stocks and securities.
		- Direct ownership
	- Most investment tends to be this type of investment because individuals have very minute shares in companies which is very fluid (easily sold).
- Net change in (financial) Reserve Assets
	- Consists mainly of changes in the RBA's holdings of foreign currency.
		- e.g. Exchange rates
- Financial Derivative
	- The purchase of sale of financial derivatives (i.e. financial contracts between two parties where the value is derived from another financial instrument, such as a bond and share)
		- No intrinsic value
		- A contract or agreement
- Other Investment
	- Transactions that do not fit into one of the other categories. One example is 'trade credit', where an importer purchases goods from overseas and does not pay for the goods until they are received.
	- Another example is 'currency and deposits', where money is deposited in or withdrawn from banks across borders or banknotes and coins are transferred between countries.

#### Capital Account

- Capital Transfers
	- Transactions where one party has transferred ownership of something for another party without receiving anything specific in return. For example:
		- Forgiveness of debt
		- Conditional grants for capital projects
		- Transfers of assets between residents and non-residents
- Acquisitions/Disposals of non-produced, non-financial assets
	- Transactions that involve intangible assets (e.g. brand names, copyrights and trademarks) and rights to use land or water (e.g. for fishing or mining)

### Net Errors and Omissions (Just need to know about its existence)

Also under capital and financial account heading in the balance of payments figures there is an item entitled Net Errors and Omissions.

This is just an adjustment that is made to the figures because of errors in the data.
