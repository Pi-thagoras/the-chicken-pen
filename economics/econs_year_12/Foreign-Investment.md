Australia’s **Net international Investment Position** (NIIP) records the stock or level of **foreign investment into Australia** (FOA) and the level of **Australian investment abroad** (AIA).

The net? International investment position (NIIP) of a country is a financial statement of the value and composition of its external financial assets and liabilities.
- A IIP value indicates that it is a **creditor nation**, while a negative value indicates that it is a **debtor nation**.

The **stock of foreign investment into Australia** is referred to as **foreign liabilities**
- A LIABILITY is something you OWE

The **stock of Australian investment abroad** is known as **foreign assets**
- An ASSET is something you OWN

**Examples of Foreign Assets and Liabilities:**
- If a firm in the United states invests in the Australian share market or invests money into the Australian financial market, this represents an **increase in Australia‘s foreign liabilities** - an increase in net capital **inflow** or inbound foreign investment.
- If, on the other hand, an Australian firm *buys* shares in an overseas company or *lends* money to a foreign bank then this would represent an **increase in Australia foreign assets** – an **outflow** of capital or foreign investment abroad

Foreign investment – an inflow of money from overseas
- Foreign liabilities – created when Australian residents borrow from overseas or sell assets such as shares to foreign residents
- Foreign assets - created when Australian residents lend money to foreign residents or purchase foreign assets - It is called Australian investment abroad and is an outflow of money

Foreign Liabilities > Foreign Assets = A negative IIP value (!!!does not mean its bad)

It is interesting to know that the rate at which foreign assets (97% of GDP -> 155% of GDP) increased is higher than foreign liabilities (155% of GDP -> 193% of GDP).

Net foreign liabilities have been increasing over 2010 to 2022 by 10%.
- BUT measured as a percentage of GDP, net foreign liabilities have actually decreased significantly – from 58 per cent of GDP in 2010 to 37 percent in 2022.


Debt and Equity (ignore for now):
- Debt - **Borrowing** (inflow cash) or **lending** (outflow cash)
- Equity - **purchases** (outflow cash) and **sales** (inflow cash) - these are same as buying and selling
- If Australian residents (households, firms or government) **borrow** form overseas, then this increases Australian foreign **debt** liability
- If Australian residents **sell** assets to overseas residents, then this increases Australia's foreign **equity** liability.
	- Sell assets -> Outflow of money -> Liability
- Australia’s net foreign debt in 2022 was $1,158 billion, while net foreign equity was -$324 billion – Why is the equity figure negative?
	- This means that Australia now owns more foreign equity than it owes, so in fact net foreign equity is no longer a liability – it is now an asset.
- Borrowing funds is seen as being a more prudent and flexible approach compared with selling assets.
- Foreign debt (borrowing) needs to be serviced with interest payments, while foreign equity (sales) involves the remittance of profits and dividends.
