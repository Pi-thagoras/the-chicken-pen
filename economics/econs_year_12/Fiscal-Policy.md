Every individual, household, business firm or organisation has a budget in which it identifies its sources of income and the ways in which those funds will be spent over a period of time.

The federal Budget, usually delivered in Parliament in May each year, estimates **government revenue** and **spending** (expenditure) plans for the coming year.

The Commonwealth budget has a three functions.
- Firstly, it decides **how revenue will be raised and allocates funds to areas of need.**
	- Budget allocations don’t really change much from year to year because they are often determined by the funding needs of the public sector.
	- For example, education spending can’t be cut by 20 percent one year then raised by 20 percent the next, because it is an essential public service that provides for the needs of school – age children
- Secondly, **the budget plays a role in income redistribution.**
	- Wealthy households pay higher rates of tax, and those on lower incomes receive more government support (both direct and indirect) than those on high incomes.
- Thirdly, the government can **use the budget to influence the level of macroeconomic activity** (i.e to stabilise fluctuations in the business cycle).
	- In Australia, the first time a budget was deliberately used for this purpose was in 1951-52, when the budget was designed to cool the booming post war economy – inflation was above 15 percent and unemployment less than one per cent of the work force.

The ‘**outcome**’ of the budget refers to - **the relationship between government revenue and government spending.**
- There are 3 possible outcomes:
	- A **balanced budget** - revenue and expenditure are equal (G = T)
	- A **surplus budget** - revenue is greater than spending (T > G)
	- A **deficit budget** - spending exceeds revenue (G > T)

A surplus budget will occur when GDP growth is strong and the economy is close to full employment.

A deficit budget will occur in the opposite scenario when GDP growth is relatively slow or when the economy has contracted

It is almost certain that the **actual budget** result at the end of the year will **differ** from the **planned outcome**, for a number of reasons.
- Should there be a downturn in economic activity, business conditions would be tougher and taxation revenue from households and businesses would fall - actual deficit would be worse than the planned deficit
- On the other hand, an unanticipated upswing after the announcement of the budget would result in rising government revenues and lower welfare spending, in which case the actual outcome would be a smaller deficit than the forecast outcome.

Changes in conditions in world markets could impact on the budget outcome.
- Higher costs (such as rising oil prices) would put pressure on the budget because they signal higher transport charges.
- A fall in commodity prices (perhaps a fall in iron ore prices) would have significant impact on tax revenue.

Exogenous factors (external shocks) could also cause the actual outcome to differ from the predicted result.
- This has been evident in recent years with bushfires and floods in the eastern states, the coronavirus pandemic; and the Ukraine War.
- These events could not have been anticipated in the budget forecasts for the relevant years.

When the government records a **budget deficit** (spending is greater than income) then the difference needs to be financed – usually this is through government borrowing.

A **budget surplus** will mean that the government is now saving and can use the surplus funds to retire past debt or saved for the future.
- A budget deficit will have an expansionary effect on the economy because there is a net injection of funds into the economy.

### Ways of Financing a Budget Deficit

There are 4 main ways in which a government can **finance a budget deficit**:
1. Selling new government bonds to domestic and/or overseas residents.
2. Borrowing from the central bank
3. Borrowing from overseas; and
4. Selling government assets

#1 **Selling new government bonds**
- Known as Commonwealth Government Securities (CGS). This method normally accounts for around 95 per cent of the government borrowing requirement.
- A bond is a financial instrument which raises funds for its issuer (in this case, the government), in return for a rate of interest payable to the buyer. 
- They are guaranteed by the government and are very popular with institutional and private investors.
- They can be bought by both domestic and foreign residents.
- In 2022, of the $892 billion worth of CGS on issue, 45 percent were owned by overseas residents.
- If you use surplus cash to buy a $1000 government bond, on which the rate of interest is 2 per cent p.a. you are effectively lending money to the government in return for an annual interest payment of $20
- When the government issues new bonds it is competing for funds in the financial market.
- This can lead to interest rates rising which can discourage private borrowing - government borrowing creates higher demand for funds in the financial market.
	- Economists call this ‘**crowding out**’ – the private investment spending is said to be ‘crowded out’ by the higher government spending.
	- But selling bonds to domestic residents has the advantage that it does not affect the money supply – the public withdraws money from the banking system to pay for purchases of securities.
	- When the government spends the borrowed funds, the net effect on the money supply is nil.

#2 **Borrowing from Central Bank**
- A second method of financing the deficit is to borrow from the central bank (RBA) - This is referred to as ‘**printing money**’. uh ohhhhhh
- While this will have the desired expansionary effect on the economy, it could lead to higher inflation rates because it is directly increasing the money supply
- The Reserve Bank has recently stated that it will not finance the current government’s deficit.

#3 **Borrowing from Overseas**
- Thirdly, the government could borrow from overseas to fund a deficit, but this is rarely used.
- It would mean the government would seek loans from foreign banks or governments rather than issuing new government securities.
- If the government used this method it would directly add to the government’s foreign debt and result in an **appreciation** of the Australian dollar due to the inflow of money capital.
- An appreciation would **counter the expansionary objective** of the planned budget deficit by reducing exports - exchange rate appreciation makes exports less competitive, and imports more competitive against domestic goods.
- This would be counter to the objectives of the planned budget deficit.

#4 **Selling government Assets**
- The final method the government could use is to sell government (public assets).
- It can do this by privatising government business enterprises or by selling government property such as public land and/or building.
- While this method can raise finance, it is not used often because it can compromise the level of public services delivered in some situations.

What impact does a surplus have on public finances?
- The surplus could be used to retire (pay off) government debt built up by past deficits,
- held over to fund future expenditure,
- or returned to taxpayers (perhaps as a direct payment, perhaps as a tax cut).
