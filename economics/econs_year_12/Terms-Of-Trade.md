The terms of trade is an **index** which measures the relative **movements in the prices** of exports and imports
- The terms of trade index is measured as a  - ratio of export prices to import prices
- Terms of Trade = (Export Price Index / Import Price Index) x 100
	- These are change in prices of exports/imports

Changes in price of exports and imports affect the value of exports and imports:
- Therefore, movements in the terms of trade can have a significant influence on the **trade and current account balance**, the **exchange rate** and **national income (GDP)**

The importance of the terms of trade index is that it provides a measure of the quantity of imports a country can obtain in exchange for a given volume of exports.
- If the terms of trade rises, then to purchase a given quantity of imports will require a smaller quantity of exports.
- Rises in terms of trade is referred to as a favourable movement - since there is an increase in standard of living

An Example: Export prices
- BHP is receiving \$60 per tonne of iron ore and is exporting 1 billion tonnes - This means that the value of their exports equals \$60 billion.
- If the world price of iron ore rises to \$80 per tonne, the value of their 1 billion exports is now \$80 billion
- This is good for Australia: its export price index has risen – this will increase the trade balance and result in an increase in Australia's national income.

An Example: Import prices
- One of Australia’s main imports is petroleum refined from oil.
- If oil prices increase from \$50 per barrel to \$60 dollars per barrel, the value of oil imports will increase by 20 percent.
- A rise in oil prices, ceteris paribus, will increase the import price index - this means that Australian households and firms will face a higher petrol bill.


An index number is a statistical device used to express price changes as a percentage of prices in a base year.
- You set a point of reference and set it at 100, any deviations from that year influence the index from 100

Remember: Australia’s exports consist mainly of primary commodities (especially resources), while imports are denominated by manufactured goods.
- If such a large proportion of exports are commodity prices, an **increase** in commodity price index will increase Australia's export price index and the terms of trade.

The price of commodities can be subject to WIDE FLUCTUATIONS due to their inelastic demand and supply - small shifts in demand and/or supply will cause large price swings.
- Increases in demand for commodity prices due to other foreign economies expanding, will increase the Australia's export price index.
- Australia exporters will allow them to sell their output for higher prices and increase their export revenue.

The bulk of Australia’s imports are manufactured and intermediate goods.
- The supply of manufactured goods is relatively more elastic so changes in demand do not cause large supply swings
- Manufactured goods can be stored and have stock changing supply easily

Export price index has a much higher impact on terms of trade - a key driver.
