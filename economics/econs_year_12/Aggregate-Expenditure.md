**Aggregate Expenditure** is the sum of all **expenditure** on **final goods and services** undertaken in the economy during a **specific time period**.
- Consumption - (household expenditure on final goods and services)
- Investment - (spending on capital equipment (intermediate goods, raw materials))
- Government spending - G1 (Day to Day expenses which are always the same) G2 (Capital Expenditure that can fluctuate depending on the day)
- Net exports - (export revenue **minus** import expenditure)
- AE = C + I + G + (X-M)

Australia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2021-2022 amounted to nearly $2.1 trillion dollars ($2,091 billion).

Any AE or AD/AS model requiring questions: mention inventories.

## Consumption

The **largest component of aggregate expenditure was CONSUMPTION expenditure** – household expenditure on goods and services.
- Consumption (C) accounted for 53.0 percent of the total ($1,103 billion)
- Consumption consists of:
	- Expenditure on non–durable goods;
	- Expenditure on durable goods; and
	- Expenditure on services

Goods are tangible (they can be seen and touched).
- **Non-durable goods** are consumed shortly after purchase (technically, up to three years) and tend to be **necessary (non-discretionary)**
	- This includes food, drinks, fuel, cosmetics, cleaning products, textiles, clothing and footwear. Much of this spending could be regarded as essential, as it satisfies the regular needs of most households. 
	- As a result, non – durable consumption spending is fairly stable over time, typically accounting for about **35 percent** of total consumption expenditure
- **Durable good**s last for a longer period of time – by definition three or more years.
	- Durable goods include white goods (large items such as washing machines, fridges, ovens); brown goods (light household items such as computers audio equipment and televisions); furniture; sporting equipment; and motor vehicles.
	- Spending on durable goods is usually ‘**discretionary**’ (meaning it can be postponed or brought forward, depending on the individual household’s circumstances).
	- Expenditure on durable goods is thought to account for about **15 percent** of aggregate consumption
- **Services** are intangible and usually provide transitory satisfaction of wants - examples include education, transport, health, and household utilities.
	- In modern economies, spending on services makes up the largest of the three slices of the consumption cake, accounting for **50 percent of all household expenditure (C)**.
	- Some services are regarded as essential, such as education, health services and transport, while others are discretionary, such as spending on entertainment and leisure.

## Investment

The second component of aggregate expenditure is private sector investment
- Economists DEFINE INVESTMENT as spending on new capital goods and additions to inventories.
- A capital good is any item of machinery that is used to assist labour in the production process
- Investment Spending in the national accounts (gross private investment) is divided into three categories:
	- **Business investment** – privately funded business spending on capital goods used in production – equipment, machinery and buildings;
	- **Housing Investment** – private expenditure on new housing; and
	- **Inventories** – unsold goods, sometimes described as ‘stock’
