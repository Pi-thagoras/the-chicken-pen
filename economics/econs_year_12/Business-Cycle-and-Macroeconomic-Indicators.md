## The Business Cycle

The **business cycle** is the term used to describe the short-run fluctuations in expenditure, output and income that occur around an increase in real GDP over the long run.

Typically the cycle is described as having two phases and two turning points:
- The **expansion** or upswing phase;
- The *upper turning point* (the peak of the cycle);
- The **contraction** or downswing phase; and
- The *lower turning point* (trough)

A full business cycle may take between 7-9 years, with expansions tending to occur slowly as an expansion develops, followed by a relatively sharp period of contraction.

The upward sloping green line represents the long term growth that results from increases in population and the labour force; the stock of capital equipment; technological change and improving productivity.

The blue line depicts a regular cycle of contraction and expansion.

### Characteristics of Each Phase

The **expansion** is a period during which real GDP is increasing.
- It is associated with an increase in production (output of goods and services), which results in greater use of productive factors such as labour; more wages (in aggregate) and higher levels of spending.
- <u>The expansion phase of the cycle features some typical characteristics:</u>
	- Rising business investment in the capital equipment needed to produce goods and services;
	- Rising levels of household consumption spending, particularly on discretionary items;
	- Confidence in household and business sectors;
	- Higher business profitability;
	- Relatively high utilisation of productive capacity;
	- Increasing labour market participation; and
	- Falling cyclical unemployment
- The expansion phase can’t last forever, as **economic activity is limited by the economy’s productive capacity** – how many workers there are to make the products, how many consumers there are to purchase them; how much capital equipment is available for workers to use; and how productive they are.
- The level of economic activity will reach a **peak** (upper turning point)

As the cycle **peaks**, the increases of income, and output expenditure that characterised the expansion start to level off.
- Optimism gives way to uncertainty, and households and firms adjust their expectations about the future and reduce their planned spending.
- Inventories (stocks of goods that have not sold) rise – a signal that firms should cut production.

The **contraction** is the period during which real GDP is falling.
- Businesses record a fall in sales, and respond to this reduction in demand by producing fewer goods and services. As a result, the use of productive input falls.
- Unemployment rises, households incomes fall and spending on goods and services declines
- The business cycle model also uses the term ‘recession’ for the period of economic contraction, but, the term is often reserved for times when there has been two successive quarters (3-month periods) of negative growth.
- <u>Contractions are characterised by:</u>
	- Rising levels of cyclical unemployment;
	- Reduced company profits;
	- Lower sales of consumer durables;
	- Lower levels of consumer and business confidence;
	- Stable, or sometimes lower prices;
	- Higher savings rates; and
	- Lower interest rates

Periods of contraction tend to be relatively short and sharp compared to periods of expansion. and the **lower turning point** marks the end of the contraction and the start of a new growth period.
- This may feature firms replacing or updating worn out capital equipment, in which case investment spending resumes.
- Businesses might undertake product and process innovation (new products and more efficient processes) to stay in business, attract buyers and gain a ‘competitive advantage’ over their rivals.
- The level of economic activity and confidence gradually rises as the economy starts to expand again.
- In modern economies, the end of the contraction could also be supported by fiscal and monetary policy.

The Business cycle model depicts a fairly smooth and regular transition from one period of the cycle to another.

Note: This is unusual in the real economy since fluctuations in economic activity can vary both in length and amplitudes.

### Explaining the Business Cycle

One explanation is that cycles are '**endogenous**' (Internal Influences)
- This means that some types of spending in the economy are likely to rise and fall themselves over time.
- An example is business investment.
	- Investment is expenditure on equipment that businesses use to assist labour in the production of goods and services (i.e capital equipment)
	- Investment decisions are essentially driven by two things - current and expected profitability, and the cost and availability of the funds used for capital spending.
	- When household spending is rising, firms invest to take advantage of expected sales and profit.
	- Once businesses have enough equipment to handle the anticipated demand in the future, there will be fewer opportunities to profitably employ more capital equipment.
	- Over-investment gives way to under-investment until the capital equipment built in expansion is worn out (depreciated) and requires replacement. 
	- Investment fluctuations partly occur because capital equipment lasts for a long period of time.
- Another example of an endogenous influence on the business cycle is that households and businesses take on more debt in a period of economic expansion because they expect that the vale of assets such as property and shares will rise.
	- Eventually however, the debt burden becomes excessive, so households and businesses cut back their spending and increase savings to reduce debt.
	- Saving more is good for an individual household, but if all households save more, aggregate spending must fall.

Another explanation is that they are '**exogenous**' (External Influences)
- Such shocks could be positive or negative, and are ‘random’ in nature.
- Examples of negative shocks include climatic events (good seasons and bad seasons, floods and droughts); geopolitical events; and the epidemics - pandemics that affect community health.
	- These shocks disrupt production, employment, income and prices throughout the economy.
	- The mining construction boom a decade ago could be regarded as a positive shock because so much capacity was developed in a short period of time to satisfy unexpected overseas demand for iron ore and gas.
	- Perhaps climate change will act as a positive shock in the near future, because huge investment in infrastructure will be required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
