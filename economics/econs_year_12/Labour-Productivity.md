Most of the time when LRAS curve shifts, the SRAS shifts as well

Productivity: Refers to the efficiency with which people or firms convert productive resources into outputs of goods and services.

$$Labour Productivity = Q/L$$

Where $Q$ represent output and $L$ is the number of hours worked

Simply put, labour productivity will rise if:
- More output can be produced or a given level of labour input, or
- Less labour input is required to produce a given amount of output

Labour Productivity can be separate into two components: (**CANNOT BE TESTED SPECIFICALLY**)
- **Capital Deepening**; and
	- Capital deepening refers to the accumulation of more capital equipment per worker - growth in the ratio of capital to labour (K/L)
	- Increasing capital deepening means more capital per worker
	- Typewriter vs Computer
- **Multi-factor productivity** (MFP)
	- All the 'other' changes in the quantity and quality of productive inputs 
		- Increases in human capital
		- Research and development
		- Improvements in management practices
		- Innovation in products and productive processes
		- Competition in the economy which promotes the entry of new innovation businesses (Deregulation)
			- More competition -> better ones survive
