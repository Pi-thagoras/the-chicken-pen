\*Most of the time when LRAS curve shifts, the SRAS shifts as well

Tip for ADAS Diagram to explain productivity: Make sure to move the LRAS curve with the SRAS when productivity improves. Productive capacity increases -> lowers business costs (cost of production! must be mentioned when SRAS shifts) -> also means the SRAS will increase due to the increased efficiency

Only supposed to shift the LRAS and SRAS curves when productivity improves. **(WACE EXAM**)
- But also shift AD and say the next period it could result in an increase in AD -> due to higher rewards for labour, business profits, and government taxes.

Any increase in productive capacity means that an economy can achieve non-inflationary improvements in economic growth.
### Productivity: Drivers/Factors

These are the drivers of productivity that 'do more with less' in the long term:
- **Investment in physical capital and infrastructure (Capital Deepening)**
	- Machinery, equipment, buildings, communication and transport. Investment implies capital deepening – more capital equipment per worker
	- <u>Stock and Quality</u> of capital equipment
- **Investment in human capital** through education and training is a key driver of productivity because it increases workers’ skill sets
	- Their ability to use capital equipment, to be creative, to solve problems and to implement innovations;
- **Research and Development (R&D), invention and Innovation (Technological Progress)** – searching for and applying new technologies and ideas.
	- There are **three types of innovation**: **product, process and organisational**, referring respectively to innovations in the nature of products and services; innovations in productive methods and processes and the implementation of new methods in a firms business practices workplace organisation and relations with other firms in their supply chain.
- **Enterprise** (management and entrepreneurship) combines other factors of production and is a crucial determinant of a firms ability to become more efficient and deliver better service, recognise opportunities and adapt to market changes to improve operations.
	- More entrepreneurs -> produce more efficiency and boosts competition
- **Competition** creates incentives to innovate and ensures that resources are allocated to the most efficient firms; and at an economy
	- Deregulation

### Productivity

Productivity: Refers to the efficiency with which people or firms convert productive resources into outputs of goods and services.

$$Labour Productivity = Q/L$$

Where $Q$ represent output and $L$ is the number of hours worked

Simply put, labour productivity will rise if:
- More output can be produced or a given level of labour input, or
- Less labour input is required to produce a given amount of output

Labour Productivity can be separate into two components: (**CANNOT BE TESTED SPECIFICALLY**)
- **Capital Deepening**; and
	- Capital deepening refers to the accumulation of more capital equipment per worker - growth in the ratio of capital to labour (K/L)
	- Increasing capital deepening means more capital per worker
	- Typewriter vs Computer
- **Multi-factor productivity** (MFP)
	- All the 'other' changes in the quantity and quality of productive inputs 
		- Increases in human capital
		- Research and development
		- Improvements in management practices
		- Innovation in products and productive processes
		- Competition in the economy which promotes the entry of new innovation businesses (Deregulation)
			- More competition -> better ones survive

### Productivity: Policies

No need to rope learn!:
1. Labour market and workplace relations
2. Taxation reform
3. Trade liberalisation
4. Infrastructure Policy
5. Education and training
6. Research and Innovation
7. Deregulation and competition policy

### APF (Aggregate Production Function)

K: Capital, L: Labour

APF: A descriptive model that explains something.

All goods and services are produced by combining resources (natural, human and capital).

At the firm level, production occurs when a firm employs labour and capital equipment to convert inputs (natural resources) into a final good or service.

At the macro level (the whole economy), the aggregate production function (APF) model was developed to explain the causes of economic growth.

In the figure, the APF, PF1, shows the relationship between two variables – the labour force and the real GDP, holding other factors constant, such as the quantity of capital and the state of technology.
- The X-axis shows the size of the labour force in millions of people, and the Y-axis shows real GDP in billions of dollars.

Note that the APF is **not a straight line** - it is curved downwards – which means it rises at a decreasing rate.
- This is because of the economic principal known as **Law of Diminishing Returns** (LDMR) which holds that if more units of labour are used with a fixed amount of capital input, then output will rise, but at a decreasing rate.
