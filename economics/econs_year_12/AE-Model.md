## The AE Model: The Consumption Function

The Keynesian expenditure model is based on the relationship between the level of disposable income received by households and the level of consumption and saving. 
- This is known as the CONSUMPTION FUNCTION
- Initially we **assume** that there is **no government sector and no overseas sector** – so there are only two possible ways that people can use their disposable income: **spend it or save it**

Assumption: Y= C + S, Income = Consumption + Savings

Y-axis: Consumption Spending, X-axis: Disposable Spending

The **45 degree line** is equidistant between the two axes and thus shows all possible points where **planned expenditure equals total income**
- When the consumption function intersects the 45 degree line - The economy is in **‘equilibrium’**
- This means that the level of income output and spending in the economy is in balance – **the level of economic activity is stable**

At a point higher than the equilibrium, savings is positive
- The amount earned is not equal to the amount spent.
- The gap between the consumption curve and the 45 degree curve is the amount saved

At a point lower than hte equilibrium, savings is negative
- The amount earned is not equal to the amount spent.
- The gap between the consumption curve and the 45 degree curve is the amount dissaved (usage of accumulated savings)

$$C = a + bY$$

The right hand side of the equation has two parts.
- The variable ‘**a**’ is the vertical intercept – the point where the consumption function meets the y-axis
	- This (**a**) is described as **autonomous consumption** (not affected by income usually non-discretionary) – there would be some level of aggregate spending even if consumers had no income (presumably households would draw on savings or claim transfer payments)
- The second part of the right hand side (the variable ‘**b**’) is the rate at which consumption (C) changes when income (Y) rises – the slope of the consumption line.


If the equation is C = 60 + 0.6Y
- This means that if income was zero, the autonomous level of consumption for the economy would be $60
- For every $1 increase in disposable income, households will spend 60 cents and save 40 cents;
- The 0.6 is the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)
	- **The MPC is the proportion of any change in income that is spent on consumption**
	- MPC = change in C divided by change in Y
- Hence the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) is, the fraction of any change in income that is saved, and in this case is 0.4
- MPC + MPS = 1
- **The size of the MPC depends on the attitude of consumers to spending and saving.**
