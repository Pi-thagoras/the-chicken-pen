Efficient Allocation of Resources (Taken out of Course)
- Where resources are allocated to their most efficient use (Ensuring more even distribution of the economic pie)
- Government achieves this through measures like:
	- Direct provision of services like nation defence...

## Taxation

Key Concepts:
- Impact: Where the tax is levied or collected
- Incidence: Where the burden of the tax falls
- Specific Tax: Charged on the volume of sales regardless of price
- Ad Valorem (Value added tax): Levied as a percentage of price
	- E.g. Real estate or personal property

**Direct Taxation**
- Collected from the taxpayer's income (Individual or corporate)
	- Impact and incidence falls on the same person

**Indirect Taxations**
- Impact and incidence fall on different people
	- E.g. excise tax or GST

**Progressive Tax**
- Increasing proportion of tax as income increases
	- Burden mainly falls on those who earn higher levels of income

**Regressive Tax**
- Decreasing proportion of income taxed as income increases
	- Greater burden on lower income earners
	- E.g. Excise tax: Low income earner will be taxed a higher proportion of their income
	- E.g. GST: Everyone pays 10% tax so burden falls more on low income earners
	
**Proportion Tax**
- Constant proportion of income
	- E.g. Australia company tax: 30% for big companies and 27.5% for small
