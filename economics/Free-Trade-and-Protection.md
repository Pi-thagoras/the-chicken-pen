## Free Trade

This is defined as the absence of government intervention of any kind in international trade, so that trade takes place without any restrictions or barriers between individuals or firms in different countries.

There is a general agreement among economists that free trade and reductions of trade barriers have a **positive** effect, they also may have **negative** effects.

### Australia's Significance of Trade

- World’s Largest Exporter of iron ore, coal and wool
- 2nd largest exporter of Aluminium ores and beef
- 3rd largest exporter of copper ores
- 4th largest exporter of wine, sugar and cotton
- 5th largest exporter of pearls
- 6th largest exporter of gold

Trade is extremely important to the Australian economy.
- **As a proportion of growth**:
	- Trade represents 46 percent of GDP for Australia.
- **Driver of growth**
	- Over the last 30 years Australia’s economy has doubled, with exports accounting for over a quarter of this growth.
- **Liberalisation (trade)**
	- Over past 30 years contributing to higher real GDP (income)
- **Employment**
	- 1 in 5 Australians are employed in a trade related activity. 
		- In Export related industries (e.g. agriculture, minerals and energy) and also sectors related to the importation of goods and services.
- **Consumer Welfare**
	- Access to wider variety of goods and services at more competitive prices.
	- Improves standard of living due to affordability.
	- Prices of Aud. Vis. and computing equipment fallen over 50 percent in the last 5 years.
		- Imports: Reduces cost of production due to lower or removal of tariffs. Increases employment. Over half of imports are essential inputs to produce goods locally.
- **Competition**
	- From overseas markets compels Australian firms to innovate and adopt more efficient methods. Improved efficiency boosts economic growth.

## Specialisation

**Specialisation** occurs when an individual, firm or country concentrates production on one or a few goods and services.
- This refers to specialisation by a country in the production of a range of goods or services that it can produce efficiently (at a low cost)

A country has to consume all goods and services that are produced if it does not trade, and therefore cannot specialise.

However, if it uses its resources to specialise in the production of those goods and services it can produce more efficiently (with lower costs of production), it can produce more of these, and trade some of them for other goods produced more efficiently in other countries.

This way an economy is able to produce a greater quantity of output because it does not ‘waste’ its scarce resources on producing goods and services at a relatively high cost.

It can also increase consumption of goods and services, because by exporting part of its larger domestic output in exchange for other output produced more cheaply elsewhere, it can acquire a larger overall quantity of goods and services.

This is basically the **theory of comparative advantage**.


**International specialization** is possible due to the uneven distribution and quality of resources between nations.
- Australia has a lot of natural resources
- And for example, Japan lacks these natural resources but has a very large workforce and highly developed industrial base
	- Hence why Japan has developed an expertise in producing high quality manufactured goods like motor vehicles and electronic equipment

Benefits:
- Differences in the **distribution of resources** in terms of quantity and quality will affect the **cost of supplying goods and services**.
- If production costs differ then countries will benefit by:
	- Specializing in the goods and services in which they are most efficient
		- Exporting surplus production and importing those goods and services in which they are less efficient at producing domestically

## Absolute and Comparative Advantage


Example Table: 

|              | Good 1 | Good 2                           | 
| ----------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------|
| China     | 100 (1/2)      |   50 (2)               |
|Australia |400 (1/4) | 100 (4)|

4 key assumptions:
- Two Countries
- Two Goods
- Perfectly Mobile (Transport is not an issue)
- The two countries have same resources

Absolute Advantage: You can make more of a good with the same amount of resources

We trade based on the concept of opportunity cost, where we trade the good with the lower opportunity cost.

When we export, we operate on world price not domestic price. The supply curve is all the suppliers in the world that produce the same good.

You cannot produce beyond the PPF, but you can consumer beyond your PPF by trading!


**Comparative Advantage is the argument for trade, so that we can specialise in a good which we have a lower opportunity cost in.**
- Trading allows us to consume more


## Stepped Out Example

<image src="/the-chicken-pen/assets/Ab_and_Com_Advantage.png" alt="Absolute and Comparative Advantage Table" width=600px />

We can see in this table, that there are two different countries; Australia and China. Furthermore, there are two goods which are bread and cheese. We are assuming there are no more countries to trade with, and no more goods that these countries can produce and trade.

Remember: This table shows an **"either or" situation**, where each country can either choose to use all their resources in one good, sacrificing the production of the other good.
- So in this case, Australia can choose to produce either 1000 loaves of bread or 100 kilograms of cheese. China can choose to produce either 800 loaves of bread or 200 kilograms of cheese.

**Australia** has the **absolute advantage** in **bread** in this economy, while **China** has the **absolute advantage** in **cheese** in the economy. This is because they can produce more of that good that they have an absolute advantage in with the same amount of resources. (Remember we assume that each country have the same amount of resources at their disposal but we know this is not true in the real economy)

There is also an opportunity cost when producing either goods. We can give a value to each good for each country the could produce it.

Opportunity Cost for **Australia**:
- To produce 1 loaf of bread, they give up producing 1/10th of a kilogram of cheese. (Cheese quantity divided by bread quantity)
- To produce 1 kilogram of cheese, they give up producing 10 loaves of bread. (Bread quantity over cheese quantity)

Opportunity Cost for **China**:
- To produce 1 loaf of bread, they give up producing 1/4 of a kilogram of cheese. (Cheese quantity divided by bread quantity)
- To produce 1 kilogram of cheese, they give up producing 4 loaves of bread. (Bread quantity over cheese quantity)

I have added it to the table below, where the opportunity cost of producing one of the good is in brackets in it's corresponding box:

<image src="/the-chicken-pen/assets/Ab_and_Com_Advantage1.png" alt="Absolute and Comparative Advantage Table" width=600px />

So who has the comparative advantage? Well in this case, Australia and China have the same comparative advantage as their absolute advantages, but these can be different in some instances. Australia and China have a lower opportunity cost in producing bread and cheese respectively.

Trade. Does Australia want to trade with China and vice versa? It depends on the price of trade. This can be agreed upon with an agreement (wow!), but for our purposes let's give them both the same benefits.

**Bread Side of Things:**
- Australia has the comparative advantage in bread so they choose to trade bread in exchange for cheese.
- Without trading, they would have to give up 1/10th of a kilogram of cheese to produce 1 loaf of bread.
- This means that Australia will accept anything above 1/10th of a kilogram of cheese in exchange for 1 load of bread.
	- E.g. 1/9th, 1/5th, 1, 10 million
- On the other hand, China would have to give up 1/4 of a kilogram of cheese to produce 1 loaf of bread without trading.
- This means that China will accept giving anything below 1/4 of a kilogram of cheese in exchange for 1 loaf of bread.
	- E.g. 1/5th, 1/9th, 1/1 million
- If we meet in the middle, where both parties have equal benefits, we can reach 1/7th of a kilogram of cheese in exchange 1 loaf of bread.

**Cheese Side of Things:**
- China has the comparative advantage in cheese so they choose to trade cheese in exchange for bread.
- Without trading, they would have to give up 4 loaves of bread in exchange for 1 kilogram of cheese.
- This means that China will accept anything above 4 loaves of bread in exchange for 1 kilogram of cheese.
	- E.g. 5, 10, 420, 14 billion
- On the other hand, Australia would have to give up 10 loaves of bread in exchange for 1 kilogram of cheese without trading.
- This means that Australia will accept giving anything below 10 loaves of bread in exchange for 1 kilogram of cheese.
	- E.g. 9, 7, 1/3
- If we meet in the middle, where both parties have equal benefits, we can reach 7 loaves of bread in exchange for 1 kilogram of cheese.

As you can see, the ratio of bread to cheese is the same, and hence we can use this as a theoretical price that these countries will trade at:
- 7 loaves of bread in exchange for 1 kilogram of cheese
- Which is equal to 1 loaf of bread in exchange for 1/7th of a kilogram of cheese

### Consumption PPF

So Australia and China agree to trade at this price. Let's say Australia wants to trade 700 loaves of bread with China. Since China is specialising in cheese, they are not producing any bread, and want bread. So, China will receive the 700 loaves of bread in exchange for 100kg of cheese because the price of 1kg of cheese is 7 loaves of bread. These are the final amounts that each country has after trading.

**China:**
- Bread - 700 loaves
- Cheese - 100kg

**Australia**:
- Bread - 300 loaves
- Cheese - 100kg

We can plot these on the PPF, to compare the benefits of trading.

<image src="/the-chicken-pen/assets/Consumption_PPF_Australia.png" alt="Australia's Consumption PPF" width=600px />

<image src="/the-chicken-pen/assets/Consumption_PPF_China.png" alt="China's Consumption PPF" width=600px />

The blue line represents the original PPF, while the red dotted line represents the new **consumption** PPF curve after trading. REMEMBER: this is the consumption PPF, and hence you cannot ever produce more than the PPF, you can only consume beyond the PPF.

Now, if Australia trades all their bread for cheese with China, they will get 143kg of cheese which is more than the 100kg without trading. If China trades all their cheese for bread with Australia, they will get 1400 loaves of bread which is more than the 800 if they didn't trade.
