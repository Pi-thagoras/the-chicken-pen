## Free Trade

This is defined as the absence of government intervention of any kind in international trade, so that trade takes place without any restrictions or barriers between individuals or firms in different countries.

There is a general agreement among economists that free trade and reductions of trade barriers have a **positive** effect, they also may have **negative** effects.

### Australia's Significance of Trade

- World’s Largest Exporter of iron ore, coal and wool
- 2nd largest exporter of Aluminium ores and beef
- 3rd largest exporter of copper ores
- 4th largest exporter of wine, sugar and cotton
- 5th largest exporter of pearls
- 6th largest exporter of gold

Trade is extremely important to the Australian economy.
- **As a proportion of growth**:
	- Trade represents 46 percent of GDP for Australia.
- **Driver of growth**
	- Over the last 30 years Australia’s economy has doubled, with exports accounting for over a quarter of this growth.
- **Liberalisation (trade)**
	- Over past 30 years contributing to higher real GDP (income)
- **Employment**
	- 1 in 5 Australians are employed in a trade related activity. 
		- In Export related industries (e.g. agriculture, minerals and energy) and also sectors related to the importation of goods and services.
- **Consumer Welfare**
	- Access to wider variety of goods and services at more competitive prices.
	- Improves standard of living due to affordability.
	- Prices of Aud. Vis. and computing equipment fallen over 50 percent in the last 5 years.
		- Imports: Reduces cost of production due to lower or removal of tariffs. Increases employment. Over half of imports are essential inputs to produce goods locally.
- **Competition**
	- From overseas markets compels Australian firms to innovate and adopt more efficient methods. Improved efficiency boosts economic growth.

## Specialisation

**Specialisation** occurs when an individual, firm or country concentrates production on one or a few goods and services.
- This refers to specialisation by a country in the production of a range of goods or services that it can produce efficiently (at a low cost)

A country has to consume all goods and services that are produced if it does not trade, and therefore cannot specialise.

However, if it uses its resources to specialise in the production of those goods and services it can produce more efficiently (with lower costs of production), it can produce more of these, and trade some of them for other goods produced more efficiently in other countries.

This way an economy is able to produce a greater quantity of output because it does not ‘waste’ its scarce resources on producing goods and services at a relatively high cost.

It can also increase consumption of goods and services, because by exporting part of its larger domestic output in exchange for other output produced more cheaply elsewhere, it can acquire a larger overall quantity of goods and services.

This is basically the **theory of comparative advantage**.


**International specialization** is possible due to the uneven distribution and quality of resources between nations.
- Australia has a lot of natural resources
- And for example, Japan lacks these natural resources but has a very large workforce and highly developed industrial base
	- Hence why Japan has developed an expertise in producing high quality manufactured goods like motor vehicles and electronic equipment

Benefits:
- Differences in the **distribution of resources** in terms of quantity and quality will affect the **cost of supplying goods and services**.
- If production costs differ then countries will benefit by:
	- Specializing in the goods and services in which they are most efficient
		- Exporting surplus production and importing those goods and services in which they are less efficient at producing domestically
