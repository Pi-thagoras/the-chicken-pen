title: Australia's International Trade
---
Do not study globalization or international interdependence since these were taken out of the course
## Trade

Four trends that have affected the relationship between trade and development since the start of the millennium.
1. Economics growth of developing countries
2. Growing integration of global production though supply chains
3. Higher prices for agricultural goods and natural resources
4. Increasing interdependence of the world economy, which causes shows to reverberate more quickly.

Four Key Linkages between Countries:
- Trade
	- Purchase and exchange of goods and services from other countries
- Tourism
	- Business of providing services for people on holiday
		- Leisure, Business, and other personal purposes
		- Will be short term
- Migration
	- Movement of people from one country to another to benefit from greater economic opportunities in the receiving country
- Investment
	- Purchase of assets that are used in the future to generate wealth

### Trade Patterns

Trade Patterns refers to the composition and direction of goods and services a country trades

**Composition:** Goods refers to the different categories of goods and services a country can import and export.

**Direction:** Refers to the export destination and the origin of imports in terms of countries or groups of countries


The **direction** of Australia's is reflected in its close proximity of the Asia Pacific region, while the **composition** of its trade reflects the nation's natural resource wealth.
- Australia is very abundant in its natural resources

Trade Intensity measures an economy's integration with the world economy. A higher trade intensity means an economy is more susceptible to external shocks in the world economy.

Trade Intensity = ((X+M) / GDP) x 100

#### Factors that determine a country's trade intensity

- Relative size of the economy
- Location relative to foreign markets (proximity)
- Extent of barriers to trade (natural and artificial)

#### Factors that influence economic transactions between economies

- Exchange Rates
- World Economic Growth (RoW)
- Domestic Economic Growth
- Relative Inflation Rates
- Relative Interest Rates
	- High Interest Rates in Australia
		- Less investment in capital
- Productivity and Cost Efficiency - Cheap price to produce, cheaper prices for other countries to buy

### Patterns - Composition

#### Exports

Primary Industries dominate Australian exports
- Manufactured goods have been Australia's most important import category.
- Changes to composition have been associated with rapid increase in mineral and energy exports and the decline in rural exports.

The composition of Australia's trade will reflect its comparative advantage 
- Traditionally Australia has been a major exporter of primary commodities
- Comparative advantage comes from land and natural resources in Australia

Over the past few decades there has been a significant increase in the relative importance of mineral and energy exports and a decline in the importance of rural exports

Commodities take up a large proportion of Australia's total exports, making up 67%.
- Rural exports decreased significantly
- Natural Resources such as minerals increased

Reasons for Change:
- Rapid growth of China and other Asian economies that resulted in a major resources boom in Australia

Major Changes in the composition of Australia's Exports
1. Dramatic decline in rural exports
2. A significant increase in resource (minerals and fuels) exports
3. A relative decline in manufacturing exports
4. The increasing importance of services exports (especially tourism and education)

#### Imports

For imports the largest category is intermediate goods, consisting mainly of fuels and processed industrial goods.

Most imported foods are manufactured goods - either in the form of consumers goods or as inputs for Australian industry

**The composition of our trade is a reflection of the structure of the economy.**
- Australia has a very efficient and internationally competitive primary sector both mining and agriculture, while our manufacturing sector is smaller and relatively less efficient.

Australia's most important **service export** is education, which is almost equal to all of Australia's rural exports.

Australia's largest **import** is personal travel - Australian tourists travelling overseas: which is now greater than the value of imported consumer motor vehicles.

#### Top Ten Exports and Imports in 2020

- Iron ore and coal are Australia's largest exports
- Natural gas and education services are surprising for Australia's 3rd and 4th for exports 
- Top four export account for 50% of our exports
