This is the checklist/main points to memorise for Economics Year 11 Final Exam. Of course, I have removed many extra details which you can access in the specific sections. As well as that, there are very big parts that would be too hard to summarise so there may be some sections of the course missing.

- <u>Excess of aggregate demand</u> over aggregate supply at the full employment level of output and is caused by an increase in aggregate demand.
- Rise in the general price level resulting from an excess of demand over supply
- "Too much money chasing too few goods"
- Will also push wage prices up with higher demand for labour

**Cost Push Inflation**
- <u>Caused by a fall in aggregate supply</u>, in turn resulting from increase in wages or prices of other inputs
- Rise in production costs are passed on to consumers who have to pay higher prices for final goods and services
