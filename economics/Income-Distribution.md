## Income & Wealth

It is crucial to have an understanding of the difference between both concepts of *income*, and *wealth*.

**Income**: Receipt of spending power by persons. Such income may be productive or Non-productive.
- Productive Income: A reward to the factors of production.
- Non-productive Income: Received from the government by persons as cash social service benefits such as pensions.

There are different types of income!

**Types of Income**
- Private Income: Income earnt as an employee/self-employed person
- Gross Income: Private income plus government transfer payments
- Disposable Income: Gross income minus tax
- Final Income: Disposable income and any indirect government benefit.

**Wealth**
- Is a stock variable
- Refers to the stock of assets held, such as land, houses, shares, government securities, consumer durables such as cars, and money MINUS the liabilities including mortgage, bank loans and amounts owing on credit cards.
- It may be acquired by inheritance, income or luck.

We can combine these concepts to these descriptors, which describe the measurement of quantities.

**Stock**: Quantity measured at a fixed period of time, e.g. wealth, GDP, inventories

**Flow**: A quantity which is measured with reference to a period of time e.g. income, depreciation, expenditure

So to summarize, income is the *flow* of funds while wealth is the *stock* of assets.

**Absolute Poverty**: A situation where people live below a subsistence level of income

**Relative Poverty**: A situation where people do not achieve what our society defines as a minimum standard of living.

## Measurement of Income Distribution

Income Inequality is a measure of the unevenness in come distribution within a population.
- This can be illustrated using the Lorenz Curve and represented by the Gini coefficient.

### The Lorenz Curve

The population is ranked according to their income, from the lowest to the highest income.
- A model showing cumulative proportion of the population, ranked by income. against their cumulative share of income.

### Gini Coefficient

Measures the degree of income inequality in a country
- Value between 0 and 1
- 0 = Income Equality, 1 = Absolute Inequality
- Calculation: Area between diagonal and Lorenz Curve / entire area under the diagonal

### Explanation of Inequality

- Personal Traits
	- Personalities and talents
- Occupational conditions
	- Training, Education and responsibilities
- Opportunities
- Other factors
	- Sickness, Disabilities, Age and Luck

### Strategies for Income Distribution

**Direct Taxation**: Personal tax is progressive, higher tax earners pay greater proportion of income than lower tax earners.

**Transfer Payments**: Cash support for different groups

**Indirect Government Payments**: Social transfers increase access to basic services which may be under consumed if provided by the market.
