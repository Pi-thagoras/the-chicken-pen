# Market Failure
## **Common Property Resources and Public Goods**

#### **Classifications:**
-   Rival:
	-   Does the consumption by one party reduce the supply available for another?
-   Excludable:
	-   Is it possible to exclude a non-payer from the good or service?

**Private Goods**
-   Rival: Your consumption of the good or service means another party cannot consume it
-   Excludable: There are requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service
-   E.g. Clothing, food, stationary

**Club Goods**
-   Non-rival: Your consumption of the good or service does not prevent another party from consuming it
-   Excludable: There are requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service
-   E.g. Gyms, Concerts, Movies

**Common Property Resources**
-   Rival: Your consumption of the good or service means another party cannot consume it
-   Non-Excludable: There are no requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service
-   E.g. Fish in the ocean
-   <u>Leads to tragedy of the commons</u>
	-   Refers to the over-consumption of common property recourses, e.g. Over fishing
	-   Occurs as the resource is readily available and there are no restrictions on consumption
	-   However, once consumed the resource is not available to any other party.

**Public Goods**
-   Non-rival: Your consumption of the good or service does not prevent another party from consuming it
-   Non-Excludable: There are no requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service
-   E.g. National Parks
-   <u>Leads to free rider effect</u>
	-   Free riders enjoy the benefits of the consumption of a resource without paying for the cost of provision
	-   This can lead to over-consumption and rapid damage of a public resource


#### To try to prevent these Market Failures...

**With common property goods**
-   Enforce restrictions on consumption
-   E.g. Fishing limits, no-fishing zones, fishing licenses

**With public goods**
-   Create ownership of the resource
-   E.g. Fees for public transport, fines for damaging public property


<u>Merit Goods</u>: Goods that are produced that have large external benefits for society
-   Goods that will be underprovided in the economy if the product is left in the market

<u>Demerit Goods</u>: Goods that are produced that have large external costs for society
-   Goods that will be overprovided if left in the market

Merit and Demerit goods are both Private goods as they are both rivalry and exclusive
