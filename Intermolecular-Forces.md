## Shapes of Molecules

There are 5 basic shapes that you should get used to:
- Linear
	- E.g. HCl
- V-shaped
	- E.g. H2O
- Trigonal Planar
	- E.g. CH20 (Methanal)
- Pyramidal
	- E.g. NH3 (Ammonia)
- Tetrahedral
	- E.g. CH4 (Methane)

\* Note: White circles represent a different atom to the black circles

This is due to the **Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory** (VSEPR)
- Regions of charge distribute themselves around an atom by repulsion to maximise the distance from each other.
