# Market Power

## Types of Markets

### Perfect Competition
- Large Number of Buyers and Sellers
- Firms are price takers (no market power)
- Homogenous products
- No barriers to entry or exit
- E.g. Agricultural Markets

### Monopoly
- One Firm
- No close substitutes for product
- Firms are price setters
- High barriers to entry
- E.g. Utilities (water, energy)

### Oligopoly
- Few large firms
- Goods are close substitutes
- Barriers to entry exist
- Sellers are interdependent - Engages in strategic behaviour
- E.g. Supermarkets (Coles, Woolworths, IGA, Aldi), Telecommunication (Telstra, Optus, Vodaphone)

### Monopolistic Competition
- Many Firms
- Differentiated products, but close substitutes
- Low barriers to entry
- Information is imperfect
- Firms are price setters
- E.g. Phone industry, computers

## Barriers to Entry
- **Economies of Scale**: Permitting lower average costs to be achieved as the firm increases in size
	- Average total costs of a large firm are substantially lower than the average costs faced by a smaller firm
	- Large firms can charge a lower price than the smaller firm, and force the smaller firm into a situation where it will not be able to cover its costs
- **Branding**: Creation by a firm of a unique image and name of a product
	- Advertising campaigns that try to influence consumer tastes in flavour of the product, attempting to establish consumer loyalty
	- Does not lead to monopolies, methods used by oligopoly and monopolistic competition
	- E.g. Apple Products
- **Control of Essential Resources**: Monopolies can arise from ownership or control of an essential resource
	- E.g. DeBeers, the South African diamond firm
- **Aggressive Tactics**: When existing firms use tactics to discourage new firms from entering the market


### Legal Barriers
- **Patents**: Rights given by the government to a firm that has developed a new product or invention to be its sole producer for a specified period of time
	- They will have a monopoly during this time e.g. patents on new pharmaceutical products
- **Licenses**: Granted by governments for particular professions or particular industries
	- Do not lead to monopoly buy limit competition
	- E.g. license may be required to operate a radio or television show
- **Copyrights**: Guarantee that an author has the sole rights to print, publish and sell copyrighted work
- **Public Franchises:** Granted by the government to a firm which is to produce or supply a particular good of service
- **Tariffs, Quotas and other trade restrictions**: Limit the quantities of a good that can be imported into the country, thus reducing competition.

### Anti-competitive Behaviours
- Agreements or arrangements between firms that seek to restrain competition and remove the automatic regulation that competitive markets achieve.

#### Examples of *Illegal* Practices that Reduce Competition
- Cartel
- Collusion
- Market Sharing
- Collusive Tendering
- Predatory Pricing
- Resale Price Maintenance
- Exclusive Dealing
- Collective Boycott
- Merger


### Causes of Market Power
- A firm has market power if it is able to affect the market price by varying output
- Firms is an imperfect market have market power as they are able to do so
	- E.g. Monopoly, Oligopoly
	- Applies not only monopoly, but also to oligopoly.
- Caused by their characteristics and barrier to entry


## Policy Options to influence Market Power

### Regulation
- If there is a natural monopoly, it is not in society's interest to break it up into smaller firms, as this would result in higher average costs and would be inefficient.
- Government usually regulate natural monopolies, to ensure more socaillt desirable price and quantity outcomes.
- Government also control who enters the market.

### Deregulate
- Government regulations that restrict competition include
	- Limiting the number or types of business
	- Limiting the ability of business to compete
	- Reduce the incentives for business to compete
	- Limiting the choice and information available to consumers
- Some government regulations need to be de-regulated to enhance competition

### Legislation
- Legislation: Put in place to limit anti-competitive behaviour to achieve a greater degree of allocative efficiency
- ACCC: Aims to protect, strengthen and supplement the way competition works in Australian markets and industries
	- They enforce the competition and consumer act 2010 and other legislation promoting competition and fair trading
