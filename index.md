title: "your new jekyll website"
---

jekyll turns markdown and html files into an actual website. it uses a thing called 'YAML frontmatter' and it is pretty easy to learn. if you are viewing this inside your editor, you will notice the top bit. this is the frontmatter, which is essentially you telling jekyll what properties your file has. here, we can see that the title is "your new jekyll website". even if you won't define anything, you need this frontmatter, as it also tells jekyll that you want it to actually work with it.

\*\***this is to make stuff bold**\*\*, \**this makes stuff italics*\*, \~\~~~this strikes them out~~\~\~. sadly there is no underline in markdown formatting. you can also make headers using:

## \## hashtags like that.

finally, you can make files [\[like this\]\(test.md\)](test.md), and you can link to images too: ![\!\[like this\]\(assets/axolotl.png)](assets/axolotl.png)
