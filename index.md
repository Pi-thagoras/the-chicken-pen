title: "The Chicken Pen"
---

Hello I am Ï€-thagoras, welcome!

I guess I'm a rancher, because I have many chickens living with me in the Chicken Pen. This pen holds all my chickens - or notes. Go on, explore the Chicken Pen...

I leave notes for people. It's how I tell the future. ;)

Current Notes :-)
- [Economics Notes](Economics-Notes.md) - The Decision Making Chicken
- [Chemistry Notes](Chemistry-Notes.md) - The Chemical Scientist Chicken
- [Japanese Notes](Japanese-Notes.md) - The Anime Chicken
- [Random Rants](Random-Rants.md) - The Alarm Clock Rooster


Need more notes and can't stand the noisy *cluck cluck clucking* chickens? Well have a look at [The Town](The-Town.md).

I also have some [quotes](Quotes.md), taken from a variety of different sources. Books... Movies... Anime...


*This website is constantly being updated whenever I have new notes/other stuff to add.*
