title: "Circular Flow of Income"
---

Macroeconomic model that describes the flow of resources, goods and services, income, and expenditure between parts of the economy.
- Firms
- Households
- Government Sector
- Financial Sector
- Overseas Sector

**Product Market**: Exchange of products
- Firms provide output
- Households pay for the output

**Factor Market**: Exchange of labour, capital, land
- Households provide resources
- Firms provide income to those who provide resources

When looking at the two factor market, we must assume that:
- Households own all the resources and are buyers
- Firms are employers and produce goods and services
- Factor Market
- Product Market
- These 2 markets are interdependent


**Injections**: Inflow of money into the circular flow of income
- Investment (I)
- Government Expenditure (G)
- Exports (X)

**Leakages**: Outflow of money from the circular flow of income
- Savings (S)
- Taxation (T)
- Imports (M)


**Equilibrium**: When an economy is in equilibrium when sum of all leakages = sum of all injections
- When S+T+M = I+G+X
- All the income from households equals the expenditure on goods and services which equals the total production of the economy


When S>I: Flow of Y must contract
- Total spending is less than output
- Inventories increases due to less expenditure
- Firms decrease production
- Households receives less income due to decreased demand of goods and services
- Expenditure on goods and services will decrease and savings will decrease
- Repeated steps until S=I at a much lower level of total Y
