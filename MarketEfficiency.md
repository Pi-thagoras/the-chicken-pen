## Consumer & Producer Surplus

#### Consumer Surplus
>The difference between what a consumer is prepared to pay and what they actually pay in the market.
- Area below the demand curve and above the price point
- Marginal Benefit: Extra benefit from consuming one extra unit of the good or services.

#### Producer Surplus
>Difference between what a producer is willing to receive and what they actually receive in a market.
-   Area above the supply curve and below the price point
-   Marginal Cost: The extra opportunity cost of producing one more unit of a good or service.

Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus = Total Surplus


#### Total Surplus
>The measure of the net benefits to society from the production and consumption of the good.
-   Allocated Efficiency is achieved

#### Deadweight Loss
>The loss in Total Surplus that is avoidable.


We must maximise the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in a market - Using all resources optimally
- A desirable objective of an economic system is to maximize the well-being of society, and therefore to achieve this, we need to maximise total surplus.
