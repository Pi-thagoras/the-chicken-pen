## Key Remembering Things

### Redox

- OIL RIG: Oxidation Is the Loss of electrons, Reduction Is the Gain of electrons
- Anode to Cathode: ALWAYS -> the flow of electrons
	- Hence Oxidation occurs at anode and reduction occurs at the cathode
- In electrolysis, the anode is +ve and cathode is -ve
- Cell Potential Calculation: Cathode (Reduction Potential) + Anode (Oxidation Potential)
	- +ve cell potential value means a spontaneous reaction will occur
	- -ve cell potential value means not spontaneous :( but electrolysis can be used for it to react

### Equilibrium

- More Frequent Collisions rather than more collisions
- Rate time graphs: Temperature affects both sides then does the equalizing 

### Acids and Bases:

- Amphoteric Species: Can accept and donate protons
- Concordant Titres: Â±0.1ml from each other
- Deliquescent: Gradually absorbs moisture from the air
- Best Ideal Primary Standard Solution Properties:
	- Available in Pure Forms
	- Not Deliquescent
	- High Molecular Weight
	- Most be soluble in water under the conditions it is going to be used in
	- Molecular Formula must not vary e.g. hydrates
- Weak acids don't fully ionize in solution... so write them whole in ionic equations
