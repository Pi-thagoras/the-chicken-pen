title: Collision Theory
---

For reaction to occur, we need a collision to occur, as well as sufficient energy for the reaction to take place (which is known as activation energy).

## Factors that affect Rate of Reaction

1. **Nature of Reactants**

$$CH_{4}\space+ 2O_{2}\space->\space CO_{2}\space+2H_{2}O$$

 - This reaction is relatively slow compared to the next reaction because it requires the breaking of the bonds + the reformation of the bonds.

$$Ag^{+}\space+ Cl^{-}->\space AgCl$$

- This reaction is relatively fast, because the ions are already there, but also the +ve and -ve charges are attracted to each other.

2. **Concentration of Reactants**
	- Only gases and solution have variable concentrations.
	- If we increase the concentration:
		- There are more particles in the same space
		- More chance for particles to collide
		- Therefore greater frequency of collisions (and successful collisions)
		- And hence greater rate of reaction

3. **Subdivision of Reactants**
	- Greater surface area
		- Solids: Block -> Granules -> Powder
			- Kindling catches fire much easier than large logs.
		- Liquid: Pour -> Drop -> Spray
	- Greater change of collision
	- Greater rate of reaction

4. **Temperature**
	- Probably the most obvious one, because it is the most powerful way of increasing the rate of reaction.
	- Particles will move faster
		- More chance of collisions
	- But *also* provides sufficient energy for a larger proportion to react

5. **Presence of Catalyst**
	- Catalysts allow for a more energetically favourable pathway
	- This is done through lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur
