title: Collision Theory
---

For reaction to occur, we need a collision to occur, as well as sufficient energy for the reaction to take place (which is known as activation energy).

## Factors that affect Rate of Reaction

1. **Nature of Reactants**

	$$CH_{4}\space+ 2O_{2}\space->\space CO_{2}\space+2H_{2}O$$

	- This reaction is relatively slow compared to the next reaction because it requires the breaking of the bonds + the reformation of the bonds.

	$$Ag^{+}\space+ Cl^{-}->\space AgCl$$

	- This reaction is relatively fast, because the ions are already there, but also the +ve and -ve charges are attracted to each other.

2. **Concentration of Reactants**
	- Only gases and solution have variable concentrations.
	- If we increase the concentration:
		- There are more particles in the same space
		- More chance for particles to collide
		- Therefore greater frequency of collisions (and successful collisions)
		- And hence greater rate of reaction

3. **Subdivision of Reactants**
	- Greater surface area
		- Solids: Block -> Granules -> Powder
			- Kindling catches fire much easier than large logs.
		- Liquid: Pour -> Drop -> Spray
	- Greater chance of collision
	- Greater rate of reaction

4. **Temperature**
	- Probably the most obvious one, because it is the most powerful way of increasing the rate of reaction.
	- Particles will move faster
		- More chance of collisions
	- But *also* provides sufficient energy for a larger proportion to react

5. **Presence of Catalyst**
	- Catalysts allow for a more energetically favourable pathway
	- This is done through lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur

### Types of Catalysts

1. Homogenous Catalysts
	- These are in the same physical state as the reactants and products of the reaction.
	- E.g. Reaction between ethanol and ethanoic acid (very slow even when heat is applied)
		- Adding sulfuric acid greatly increases the rate of reaction.
		- Since sulfuric acid is a solution, and the reactants *and* products (ethyl ethanoate) are also solutions, it is very difficult to separate these into it's constituents.
		- Difficult to separate and use sulfuric acid again as a catalyst for another reaction
	
2. Heterogenous Catalysts
	- These are in different physical state from the reactants and products of the reaction.
	- E.g. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (very slow)
		- Adding Manganese Oxide greatly increases the rate of reaction
		- As manganese oxide is a solid, while hydrogen peroxide is a liquid, we can easily filter out the manganese oxide to reuse.
		- This can be easily done through filtration of the products (or product because hydrogen gas and water)

Chemists prefer to use **heterogenous** catalysts for industrial processes because they are:
- More easily separated from the products of a reaction
- Much easier to reuse
- Able to be used at high temperature
