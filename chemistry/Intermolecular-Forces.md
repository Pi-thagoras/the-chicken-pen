## Shapes of Molecules

There are 5 basic shapes that you should get used to:
- Linear
	- E.g. HCl
- V-shaped
	- E.g. H2O
- Trigonal Planar
	- E.g. CH20 (Methanal)
- Pyramidal
	- E.g. NH3 (Ammonia)
- Tetrahedral
	- E.g. CH4 (Methane)

\* Note: White circles represent a different atom to the black circles

This is due to the **Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory** (VSEPR)
- Regions of charge distribute themselves around an atom by repulsion to maximise the distance from each other.


## Non-Polar & Polar Bonds

#### Non-Polar Bond
- Even distribution of charge
- Electrons are shared equally - electrons are "in the middle"

#### Polar Bond
- E.g. Fluorine has a much higher electronegativity
- Electrons are attracted more to it
- There is an uneven charge distribution
- âˆ´ Polar Bond

### Polarity of Molecules

**To be polar:**
1. There must be at least one bond that is polar
2. Molecule must be non-symmetric

## Van der Waals Forces

- These are Intermolecular Forces between molecules
- The strength determines the M.P, B.P and other properties

#### 1. Dipole - Dipole Attraction

- These affect polar molecules only
- Due to slight differences in charges on each side of the molecule


#### 2. Dispersion Forces

- It is the only way non-polar molecules interact wich each other

1. Instantaneous dipole caused by random movement of electrons
2. Induce dipoles in neighboring molecules
3. Sets up dispersion force between molecules - The strength of the dispersion forces are determined by:
	- Number of electrons in the molecule
		- A larger number of electrons means temporary dipoles are larger and more frequent
	- Shape of molecules
		- Longer and Thinner is better

Polar Molecules <u>can</u> experience both dipole - dipole AND dispersion forces.
