## Functional Groups

**Alcohols**
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n+1}OH$ 
- Structure: –OH
- Nomenclature: -ol
- E.g. Pentan-2-ol
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Hydrogen Bonding
- Note: Position of hydroxyl group influences properties. Depending on the number of carbon atoms directly attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, we can classify alcohols by either being **primary**, **secondary**, or **tertiary** (bearing 1, 2, or 3 respectively).

**Aldehydes** - No position needed
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n}O$ 
- Structure: –CHO
- Nomenclature: -al
- E.g. Propanal
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Dipole Dipole

**Ketones**
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n}O$ 
- Structure: –CO
- Nomenclature: -one
- E.g. Hexan-2-one
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Dipole Dipole

**Carboxylic Acids** - No position needed
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n+1}COOH$ 
- Structure: –COOH
- Nomenclature: -oic acid
- E.g. Ethanoic Acid! :O... another one -> Nonanoic Acid
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Dipole Dipole, Hydrogen Bonding

**Amines**
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n+1}NH_{2}$ 
- Structure: –NH2
- Nomenclature: -amine
- E.g. Butan-1-amine, Methanamine (Tongue Twister)
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Hydrogen Bonding (Nitrogen less electronegative than oxygen hence hydrogen bonding is weaker than alcohols)

**Amides** - No position needed
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n+1}CONH_{2}$ 
- Structure: –CONH2
- Nomenclature: -amide
- E.g. Propanamide
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Dipole Dipole, Hydrogen Bonding

**Esters** - No position needed
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n+2}COO$ 
- Structure: –COO
- Nomenclature: -yl -oate
- E.g. Methyl Ethanoate, Propyl Decanoate, Hexyl Methanoate 
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Dipole Dipole, Hydrogen Bonding
- Note: Side of the chain with the double bonded oxygen is the main chain (-oate) while the side without the double bonded oxygen is the alkyl group (-yl)

| --------- | ----------------- | --- | --- |
| Strongest | Amides            |     |     |
|           | Carboxylic Acids  |     |     |
|           | Alcohols          |     |     |
|           | Ketones           |     |     |
|           | Aldehydes         |     |     |
|           | Amines            |     |     |
|           | Esters            |     |     |
|           | Ethers*           |     |     |
| Weakest   | Alkanes           |     |     |
\* Don't need to know about them but they are normal alkanes but with a cheeky oxygen in the middle to disrupt the carbon chain.


### Oxidation of Alcohols and Aldehydes

Common Oxidising Agent used:
- $K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$ - Potassium Dichromate (Focus on Dichromate Ion)
- $H_{2}O_{2}$ - Hydrogen Peroxide
- $KMnO_{4}$ - Potassium Permanganate

Using **Acidified** Permanganate results in most likely a **complete** oxidation.

Using **Acidified** Dichromate results in most likely a **incomplete** oxidation.

Remember:
- Incomplete oxidation with a 1° alcohol -> Aldehyde
	- Always has 2$H^+$ + 2$e^-$ as products in final equation
- Complete oxidation with a 1° alcohol -> Carboxylic Acid
	- Always has $H_{2}O$ as reactants and 2$H^+$ + 2$e^-$ as products in final equation
- Oxidation of Aldehydes -> Carboxylic Acid
- Oxidation of 2° alcohol -> Ketone
- 3° Alcohols NEVER oxidized

### Reactions with Sodium

Ethanol + Sodium -> Sodium Ethoxide + Hydrogen Gas

Ethanoic Acid + Sodium -> Sodium Ethanoate + Hydrogen Gas

Can be used to differentiate alcohols and carboxylic acids with other organic compounds. e.g. if you have 3 solutions - propanal, methanol, and 2-methylbutan-2-ol
- You can use permanganate ions to tell which one is the tertiary alcohol since it will not react.
- Then you can use sodium to distinguish between the aldehyde and alcohol since aldehydes do not react with sodium.
