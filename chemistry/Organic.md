## Functional Groups

**Alcohols**
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n+1}OH$ 
- Structure: –OH
- Nomenclature: -ol
- E.g. Pentan-2-ol
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Hydrogen Bonding
- Note: Position of hydroxyl group influences properties. Depending on the number of carbon atoms directly attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, we can classify alcohols by either being **primary**, **secondary**, or **tertiary** (bearing 1, 2, or 3 respectively).

**Aldehydes** - No position needed
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n}O$ 
- Structure: –CHO
- Nomenclature: -al
- E.g. Propanal
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Dipole Dipole

**Ketones**
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n}O$ 
- Structure: –CO
- Nomenclature: -one
- E.g. Hexan-2-one
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Dipole Dipole

**Carboxylic Acids** - No position needed
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n+1}COOH$ 
- Structure: –COOH
- Nomenclature: -oic acid
- E.g. Ethanoic Acid! :O... another one -> Nonanoic Acid
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Dipole Dipole, Hydrogen Bonding

**Amines**
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n+1}NH_{2}$ 
- Structure: –NH2
- Nomenclature: -amine
- E.g. Butan-1-amine, Methanamine (Tongue Twister)
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Hydrogen Bonding (Nitrogen less electronegative than oxygen hence hydrogen bonding is weaker than alcohols)

**Amides** - No position needed
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n+1}CONH_{2}$ 
- Structure: –CONH2
- Nomenclature: -amide
- E.g. Propanamide
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Dipole Dipole, Hydrogen Bonding

**Esters** - No position needed
- General Formula: $C_{n}H_{2n+2}COO$ 
- Structure: –COO
- Nomenclature: -yl -oate
- E.g. Methyl Ethanoate, Propyl Decanoate, Hexyl Methanoate 
- Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion Forces, Dipole Dipole, Hydrogen Bonding
- Note: Side of the chain with the double bonded oxygen is the main chain (-oate) while the side without the double bonded oxygen is the alkyl group (-yl)

| Weakest   | Alkanes           |     |     |
\* Don't need to know about them but they are normal alkanes but with a cheeky oxygen in the middle to disrupt the carbon chain.
