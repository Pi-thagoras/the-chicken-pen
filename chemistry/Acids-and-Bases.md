---

**Acids**
- These turn blue litmus red
- Tastes Sour (e.g. Lemon, Vinegar)
- pH < 7 (25 degrees Celsius)
- Arrhenius -> Hydrogen ions in solution, $H^+$

**Bases** (Alkalis)
- These turn red litmus blue
- Tastes bitter
- Slippery
- pH > 7
- Arrhenius -> Hydroxide Ions in solution, $OH^-$


### The 7 Strong Acids

**Hydrochloric Acid** - HCl

**Nitric Acid** - HNO3

**Sulfuric Acid** - H2SO4

**Hydrobromic Acid** - HBr

**Hydroiodic Acid** - HI

**Chloric Acid** - HClO3 (The chloric ion has a -1 charge)

**Perchloric Acid** - HClO4 (The perchloric ion has a -1 charge) [^1]


- **Chloric acid** - chloride salts manufacturing, match production, explosives production
- **Hydrobromic acid** - industrial cleaning products, lithographic printing, engraving
- **Hydrochloric acid** - stomach acid (aids in digestion), fireworks production, battery production
- **Hydroiodic acid** - acetic acid production, sanitizing medical tools, Industrial reducing agent
- **Nitric acid** - explosives production, ammonium nitrate (fertilizer), polyurethane production
- **Perchloric acid** - separating sodium from potassium, rocket fuel production, explosives production
- **Sulfuric acid** - drain cleaner ingredient, wastewater treatment, steel manufacturing

### The 8 Strong Bases

**Lithium Hydroxide** - LiOH

**Sodium Hydroxide** - NaOH

**Potassium Hydroxide** - KOH

**Rubidium Hydroxide** - RbOH

**Cesium Hydroxide** - CsOH

**Calcium Hydroxide** - Ca(OH)2

**Strontium Hydroxide** - Sr(OH)2

**Barium Hydroxide** - Ba(OH)2


- **Barium hydroxide** - glass manufacturing, grease additive, pesticide production
- **Calcium hydroxide** - dental fillings, food processing (pickling lime), wastewater treatment
- **Cesium hydroxide** - electric storage batteries, metal production, radioactive waste clean-up
- **Lithium hydroxide** - lithium ion batteries, lubricant (grease) production, soap manufacturing
- **Potassium hydroxide** - desiccant, detergent ingredient, liquid fertilizer production
- **Rubidium hydroxide** - electric storage batteries, rubidium crystals production, wastewater treatment
- **Sodium hydroxide** - lye, drain cleaner ingredient, oven cleaner ingredient
- **Strontium hydroxide** - grease manufacturing, soap manufacturing, extracting sugar from beets

### Standard Reactions

*Ionic reactions are the most appropriate way of writing equation*

Strong Acids -> Write as ions

Weak Acids -> Written in full form (Including molecules)

#### Acid/Metal

Acid + Metal -> Hydrogen + Salt

#### Acid/Carbonate

Metal Carbonate + Acid  ->  CO2 + H2O + Salt

#### Acid/Hydroxide

Acid + Metal Hydroxide  -> Salt + Water

#### Acid/Oxide

Metal Oxide + Acid  ->  Salt + Water

#### Other Common Reactions

Ammonium Salt + Base ->  NH3 + H2O

Metal Oxide + Non Metal Oxide
- E.g. Calcium Oxide reacting with carbon dioxide forming calcium carbonate

Base + Non Metal Oxide
- E.g. Sodium Hydroxide reacting with carbon dioxide forming sodium carbonate and water


[^1]: I don't know, I need to specify because some other ions/molecules do some funky stuff when they disassociate. i.e. permanganate, chromate & dichromate -> to do with highest positive oxidation state...
