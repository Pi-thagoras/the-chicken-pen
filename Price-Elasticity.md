## What is Price Elasticity?

Price Elasticity is how responsive we are to certain changes in price of goods.

#### Price Elasticity of Demand
- Measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price

**This can be measured by:**
- % change in quantity demanded / % change in price
- This is called the percentage change calculation or aka point method

**Or can be measured by:**
- Change in Quantity / Q$_{avg}$  $\times$  P$_{avg}$ / Change in Price
- This is called the midpoint average


## Types of Price Elasticity

| Elasticity          | Elasticity Co-efficient | Interpretation                                    |                                     
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Price Elastic       | E > 1                   | Change in supply is greater than change in price  |                                     
| Price Inelastic     | E < 1                   | Change in supply is less than change in price     |                                   
| Perfectly Elastic   | E = $\infty$            | Change in price results in no supply              |
| Perfectly Inelastic | E = 0                   | Change in price results in no change in supply    |                                 
| Unitary Elastic     | E = 1                   | Change in supply is equal to than change in price |                                     

#### Price Elastic
-   The quantity demanded of the product is relatively responsive to changes in price
-   Percentage change in quantity demanded > percentage change in price
-   Absolute value of elasticity of demand > 1
-   Has relatively close substitutes, e.g. Fast food / fruits

##### Price Inelastic
-   The quantity demanded of the product is relatively unresponsive to changes in price
-   Percentage change in quantity demanded < percentage change in price
-   Absolute value of elasticity of demand < 1
-   Cannot be easily substituted e.g. Cigarette or Bus fares

#### Perfectly Elastic
-   Changes in price cause an infinite changes in quantity demanded
-   So if price changes, quantity demanded falls to zero
-   Reflects a perfectly competitive market where firms are price takers

#### Perfectly Inelastic
-   Changes in price cause no changes in quantity demanded
-   So if price changes, quantity demanded does not change at all
-   Reflects a market where there is a fixed demand regardless of price, e.g. Insulin for diabetic

#### Unitary Elastic
-   Where changes in price equals to change in quantity demanded


### Factors that affect PED (Price Elasticity of Demand)
- **The availability of substitutes**
	- If there are less substitutes such as petrol, then people can't substitute that much, so inelastic
- **Whether the good is a necessity or a luxury**
	- Necessity: Inelastic
	- Luxury: Elastic
- **Proportion of income**
	- The greater the proportion of the income a good takes up: More elastic
	- Cheaper good: More Inelastic
- **Time period considered**
	- The longer time you have to respond the price changes, then the more elastic it becomes. (Such as petrol)
- **The definition of the market**
	- Inelastic to petrol
	- Elastic to specific companies such as Caltex
	- The narrower the market, the more responsive you will be

### Factors that affect PES (Price Elasticity of Supply)
- **Time Period Considered**
	- In the short run, goods will be less elastic as people don't have time to react to change
	- In the long run, goods will be more elastic as people can react to it
- **Nature of the industry**
	- If you can easily change their production, it will be more price elastic (i.e pencils)
	- If you can't easily change their production, it will be less price inelastic (i.e agriculture)
- **Ability to store inventories**
	- If a firm is able to easily store inventories, it is going to be price elastic (i.e canned stuff, doesn't go off)
	- If a firm is unable to easily store inventories, it is going to be price inelastic (i.e. Fruit as it can go off)
