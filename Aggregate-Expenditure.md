---

**Measuring Economic Performance:**
GDP:
- Expenditure Approach: Addition of all final expenditures within a country given a period of time
- National Income Approach: Addition of all income earned from factors of production that produce foods and services given a period of time
- Output Approach: Addition of all value of goods and services produced in a country given a period of time


**Aggregate Expenditure:**
- Total amount that firms, households and government plan to spend on final goods and serviecs at each level of income
- AE = C + I + G + (X - M)

**Consumption Expenditure:**
- Households expenditure on durable goods, non-durable goods and services
	- Durables: >3 years
	- Non-durables <3 years
	- Services: Non-commodity items
	- Autonomous vs discretionary
		- Autonomous: Necessities
		- Discretionary: Luxury Items
	- Approximately 58% of AE

### Factors Affecting Consumption Expenditure

- Disposable Income
	- Increase in disposable income -> increase in consumption expenditure
- Interest Rates
	- Increase -> Save more -> Consume less
- Availability of Credit
	- Access to loans -> More incentive to take loans out and spend
- Stock of Personal Wealth
	- Wealthier -> More consumption
- Expectations
	- Expectations of Whole Economy
		- Expect economy downturn, going into a recession -> Spend less
- Government Policies
	- Fiscal Policies
		- People get more money -> More consumption
		- Increase taxes -> Decrease consumption
	- Monetary Policies
		- Decrease Spending Power / Increase -> Cash Rate (RBA) -> Interest Rates

## Components of Aggregate Expenditure - Investment

- Expenditure on producer or capital goods that are used to produce final goods and services in the future
- Investment by private firms
	- Fixed Investment (usually on capital goods)
	- Residential fixed investment (private expenditure on new housing)
	- Changes in business inventories (stocks of goods that have been produced but not yet sold)
- Approximately 20% but it is very volatile

### Factors Affecting Investment

- Rate of Interest
	- Real Rates - > Accounts for Inflation
	- Nominal Rates -> Doesn't account for inflation
- Business Expectations
	- Expectation of whole economy 
- Level of past profits (Profitability)
	- Had lots of past profits -> Ability to invest with that extra money
- Government Policies
	- Monetary Polices
		- Interest Rates

## Components of Aggregate Expenditure - Government Expenditure

- All federal, state, local government expenditure
- 2 parts
	- G1: Current government expenditure on day to day functions
	- G2: Government expenditure used for future needs e.g schools and roads
- Approximately 24% of Aggregate Expenditure

### Factors Affecting Government Expenditure

- Government Policy Objectives
	- Health Policies, Education Policies
- Current Economic Climate
	- High Inflation -> Decrease government expenditure

## Components of Aggregate Expenditure - Net Exports

- Value of exports minus value of imports
	- Exports - Imports
- 0.03% of Aggregate Expenditure, volatile

### Factors Affecting Net Exports

- Exchange Rates
	- Increase in AUD (Appreciation of the Australian Dollar)
		- Imports cheaper -> Increase imports
		- Exports are more expensive -> Less competitive
		- Net Exports Decrease.
- Domestic and Overseas Economic Activity
	- Australia's Economy is good
		- Imports Increase (Capital)
	- Overseas Economy is good
		- Exports Increase
- Tariffs and Quotas
	- Tariffs -> Taxes on Imports
	- Quotas -> Limitations on trade
