## Common Property Resources and Public Goods

#### **Classifications:**
-   Rival:
	-   Does the consumption by one party reduce the supply available for another?
-   Excludable:
	-   Is it possible to exclude a non-payer from the good or service?

**Private Goods**
-   Rival: Your consumption of the good or service means another party cannot consume it
-   Excludable: There are requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service
-   E.g. Clothing, food, stationary

**Club Goods**
-   Non-rival: Your consumption of the good or service does not prevent another party from consuming it
-   Excludable: There are requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service
-   E.g. Gyms, Concerts, Movies

**Common Property Resources**
-   Rival: Your consumption of the good or service means another party cannot consume it
-   Non-Excludable: There are no requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service
-   E.g. Fish in the ocean
-   <u>Leads to tragedy of the commons</u>
	-   Refers to the over-consumption of common property recourses, e.g. Over fishing
	-   Occurs as the resource is readily available and there are no restrictions on consumption
	-   However, once consumed the resource is not available to any other party.

**Public Goods**
-   Non-rival: Your consumption of the good or service does not prevent another party from consuming it
-   Non-Excludable: There are no requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service
-   E.g. National Parks
-   <u>Leads to free rider effect</u>
	-   Free riders enjoy the benefits of the consumption of a resource without paying for the cost of provision
	-   This can lead to over-consumption and rapid damage of a public resource


#### To try to prevent these Market Failures...

**With common property goods**
-   Enforce restrictions on consumption
-   E.g. Fishing limits, no-fishing zones, fishing licenses

**With public goods**
-   Create ownership of the resource
-   E.g. Fees for public transport, fines for damaging public property


<u>Merit Goods</u>: Goods that are produced that have large external benefits for society
-   Goods that will be underprovided in the economy if the product is left in the market

<u>Demerit Goods</u>: Goods that are produced that have large external costs for society
-   Goods that will be overprovided if left in the market

Merit and Demerit goods are both Private goods as they are both rivalry and exclusive



## Externalities

**Key concepts to know:**
-   Demand: Private benefits that consumers receive
-   Supply: Private costs of production
-   MPC (Marginal Private Cost): Costs to producers of producing one more unit of a good
-   MSB (Marginal Social Cost) : Costs to society of producing one more unit of a good
-   MPB (Marginal Private Benefit): Benefits to consumers from consuming on more unit of a good
-   MSB (Marginal Social Benefit) : Benefits to society from consuming one more unit of a good
-   When MPC = MSC and MPB = MSB socially optimal equilibrium is achieved

Externalities occur when the production or consumption of a good/service cause external costs and/or external benefits to a third party.
-   Side effects of economic activity or unintended consequences of economic activity

Externalities cause market failure if the price mechanism does not take into account the social costs and benefits of production and consumption.


### Negative Externalities

Occurs when production and/or consumption creates an external cost.

Causes overconsumption/production
-   Market quantity is greater than optimal quantity
-   Market price is less than optimal price
Results in deadweight loss

**Negative Production Externality:**
-   Where the marginal social cost of production is higher than the marginal private cost
-   Examples: Air, Land, Noise, Pollution which results from factory emissions

**Negative Consumption Externality:**
-   When the marginal social benefit of consumption is lower than the marginal private benefit
-   Examples: Smoking, Alcoholism


### Positive Externalities

External Benefits if consumption or production for third parties

Causes underconsumption/production
-   Market quantity is less than optimal quantity
-   Market price is greater than optimal price
Results in deadweight loss

**Positive Consumption Externality:**
-   Where the marginal social benefit of consumption is higher than the marginal private benefit
-   Examples: Flu Vaccines, Education

**Positive Production Externality:**
-   Where the marginal social cost of production is lower than the marginal private cost
-   Examples: Lower transport costs for local firms following construction of new roads
